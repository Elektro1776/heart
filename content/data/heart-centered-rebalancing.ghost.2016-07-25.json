I do have a point here! My point here is to say that anything is possible, but not everything is *probable*. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So why are wings, a jetpack and a rekindled relationship improbable with the Law of Attraction? Simple.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>*You don’t expect to have them.*</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In order to have anything (including the wings and the trips to the moon), only one thing has to change, and that is your expectation.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">With the Law of Attraction, we create our reality through our expectation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When we see ourselves as lovable, love comes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When we don’t, it stays far, far away.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is why getting an ex back can be challenging in the midst of a breakup.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>After someone has stomped on your heart and rejected you, it can be hard to see yourself as lovable.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When you are beaten down and feeling badly, you simply aren’t in a state of expecting love to happen to you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This is why people get so sad when they are dumped.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>That former hopefulness has evaporated, and it has been replaced by an expectation of loneliness and despair.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “**[14 Things to Stop Saying Now if You Want to Find Love](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/12/03/if-you-want-to-find-love/ \"find love article\")“***\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For this reason, when I work with people who want to get an ex back, I make it 100% clear from the beginning that letting the ex go is the most important thing that needs to be done.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">*This doesn’t mean you’ll never get him or her back, *it simply means that from where you stand (energetically speaking) it is probably just about impossible to expect that this person will come back, and this lack of expectation pushes the old partner further away.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To clarify this point, let me offer a very common human experience:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Imagine you have a friend who went on a couple of dates with a guy and she ju</span><span class=\"s1\">st can’t get him out of her head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>She texts him constantly, follows him around and flirts shamelessly to get his attention. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">But instead of falling head over heels in love with her, what happens? He runs for the hills!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Now your friend is sad and down for a long time, and she becomes obsessed with getting him back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>She talks about the situation endlessly, and now she’s asking your advice on how to get him back.The situation just becomes more and more desperate, and the guy in question is only getting further and further away.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then finally, one day she decides she’s sick of obsessing about this guy and that she’s ready to move on.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>She picks herself up, and gets back out on the dating scene. She works on her happiness and gets her energy back on track.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Then what happens? </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Suddenly, Prince Charming is back sniffing around again! He texts her and calls her and tries to win back her affections. Now that she’s moved on and back to feeling good about herself, he wants to take her on a date again. Oh the irony!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Chances are you know someone who has experienced this phenomena (and maybe you’ve even experienced it yourself!).</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">See, when we allow ourselves to let go of people we have been chasing after, we stop focusing on our expectation of being unlovable, and this allows love to come to us much more easily. We put our focus on loving ourselves, and this focus attracts love back into our life.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So if you’ve been wanting to get an ex back, do yourself a favor. Make it your new goal to get over your ex, and see what happens.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Maybe the ex will come back, maybe you’ll find a new love interest, but for SURE you will start feeling better and you will release a lot of the energy that is preventing you from developing the expectation you need to find true love.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Letting go of your ex is a necessary step on the path to finding love after heartbreak.</span>\n\n***Related Article:** “**[5 Possible Reasons Why You’re Still Single](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/13/reasons-why-youre-still-single/ \"Why You're Still Single Article\")“***\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So to answer the question “can you get your ex back with the Law of Attraction?” the answer is a resounding YES.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, it is done through letting go, not through trying.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To all my friends out there licking their wounds and feeling bad about love, take heart.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You don’t have to work to get him or her back. You don’t need to strategize or think about it. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You only have to do one thing, and that is to let him or her go by doing whatever you can do to get over it. Fortunately, there are a lots of ways you can use the Law of Attraction to help you let go and get your happy back.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When you are<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>truly ready to let go and make your happiness your #1 priority, events and circumstances will shift in your life. You will start loving yourself again, and the universe will respond by bringing more love into your life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>All you have to do is put yourself first.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you have any questions about love and the Law of Attraction, feel free to**[contact me](https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/contact-raise-your-vibration-today/ \"Contact me here\")**and let me know how I can help. There are many ways you can use the Law of Attraction to recover from the sadness of heartbreak and move on to happier times.

Make it your new goal to get over your ex, and see what happens.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Maybe the ex will come back, maybe you’ll find a new love interest, but for SURE you will start feeling better and you will release a lot of the energy that is preventing you from developing the expectation you need to find true love.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Letting go of your ex is a necessary step on the path to finding love after heartbreak.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Related Article:</strong> “<strong><a href=\"https://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/13/reasons-why-youre-still-single/\" title=\"Why You're Still Single Article\">5 Possible Reasons Why You’re Still Single</a>“</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">So to answer the question “can you get your ex back with the Law of Attraction?” the answer is a resounding YES.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, it is done through letting go, not through trying.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">To all my friends out there licking their wounds and feeling bad about love, take heart.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You don’t have to work to get him or her back.

I grew up on old romantic movies and novels, I couldn’t wait to ***fall***. So, when I got older I tried to fall in love…a lot and very quickly. I wanted novel-like love, fairy-tale love, a love like Hollywood portrays. I thought love was an obsession with someone, not a commitment to them.\n\nMy unhealthy addiction with a delusional and false portrayal of love stems from a childhood of wanting to be loved. From being severely bullied to coming from a divorced family, I quickly and mistakenly learned to believe I could not be loved and if someone did love me, I did not believe them. I still hoped a ‘perfect’ and crazy kind of love existed, just not for me. It took a lot of heartbreak and stupid choices for me to understand the differences of being in love and *really *loving someone.\n\nI’m sharing this with you so you can connect with my humble journey of learning what it’s like to really love someone, to sacrifice an idea and a part of yourself to experience *real* love.\n\n***Falling In Love.***\n\nOh, gosh. It’s so sweet isn’t it? The first stages of wooing someone or being wooed. The all-consuming thoughts, manic energy and the feeling that maybe and finally you have met *the one*.  All you can think about is this mysterious human being, it is all you want to talk about. You feel you could move mountains, or at least climb one. You want it right now, there is no time to waste.\n\nThose feelings and emotions are overwhelming aren’t they? That first kiss that is brought to a halt due to a smile or a bashful giggle. You think to yourself, this person is everything I have ever wanted and I *need* them. Eventually, you come back to reality and realize this person too, has faults. They are not super-human, but just human.\n\n*Owning *someone or at least wanting to own a part of them to make yourself temporarily happy, is not actually loving someone. Own yourself and your identity, and you won’t *need* anyone.\n\nFalling ‘in love’ with someone is literally altering chemicals in your brain. In a matter of seconds after locking eyes with this person, your body starts to fall in love. In the first stages of being infatuated, all anyone talks about is how attractive the person they met is and you start to crave them like a drug. Hormones increase, pupils dilate, you become nauseous with anxiety just from thinking about them or the fact they just text you again…sound familiar?\n\nDon’t let your body chemistry trick you, everyone eventually comes down and then you are left there…wondering if this person is *really* right for you. Enjoy falling in love, but know that eventually you will start to feel different or fall right out of love with that person.\n\n***Loving Someone.***\n\nThis is a choice. Falling lead to real feeling and you chose to start a life with this wonderful person. By this point, you’ve met some of their flaws and probably have been annoyed with them a time or two, three, okay maybe four times. Loving this person means accepting them for their flaws and selflessly giving a part of yourself to them because you want them to be loved and for them to love you in return, despite your own issues.\n\nLoving someone doesn’t mean you won’t experience thoughts of immense love you have for this person, it just becomes more realistic. It may be a fleeting thought or racing heart thinking to yourself “I can’t believe this person loves me the way that they do, no matter what.” To me, that’s better than an endless stream of wild what ifs and anxiety-filled nights.\n\nYou will never own someone you truly love, you won’t want to. You want them to feel free and better themselves on a daily basis, to be confident in you and themselves. Jealousy is natural, but obsessive and controlling behavior is not real love. Everyone goes through it and everyone is guilty of being obsessive at least once. I don’t care if you hide it, the point is… you still do it. When you actually love someone, you won’t feel the need to act like this.\n\nIt’s not a chemical romance, it is real. You don’t need the constant high to remind you that you love them, it’s just there. You aren’t really searching for happiness elsewhere, you are content. Every decision you make, every hardship you face, and when you just need someone to listen, they are always there. You know that no matter what, you will always and forever love them.\n\nThere is no battle, there is only **love. **  \n**About the Author: **\n\n[**Kate Rae**](http://katerae.wordpress.com) is an intuitive writer discussing the world of mental illness and how healthy living and a little humor can greatly improve your well being.

Wow, I really don’t ever want to be someone’s trap queen…I really don’t even understand what that is.\n\nAs I witness some of our generation slowly begin to wake up, it gives me hope that we could be remembered for something great. I believe in soulmates and that there are certain people meant for you, at a certain time along your life path. I think, when you are your best (or close to it), you meet your unique counterpart. Who wouldn’t want to experience that?\n\nThe more you focus on loving yourself and those around you who deserve it (and some who don’t), the more positive the vibes you are leaking out. I wish people would just realize how important love is, because love is powerful and it could save us from a world full of selfishness, hatred, and greed.\n\nHere are some reasons why I think people are giving up on love.\n\n- **Speed Dating. **This is basically what people do, trying to find their ‘one and only’ rapidly moving through people like there is no tomorrow. Where is the spontaneity in that? The romance? No where. Dating as a sport isn’t going to get you any closer to ‘the one’. Dating someone who isn’t right for you just for the sake of dating will lead you nowhere but straight into disaster. Work on loving who you are and bettering yourself everyday, then the right person for you will come along.\n- **The Ego is Taking Over. **Part of the ego is sometimes recognized as arrogance. Boy, does our generation have a sh*t ton of that. It’s all about status, money, and how many followers you have on Twitter. An overboard of selfies so a bunch of people you may or may not know can tell you how awesome you are. The other part of the ego is insecurity. Feeling insecure when you see a beautiful picture of someone else or jealousy of how someones lifestyle is displayed through imagery.\n- **Lack of Respect For One’s Self. **Sleeping around, posting half naked pictures, and pretending to be someone you are not is all just disrespecting yourself.

Wow, I really don’t ever want to be someone’s trap queen…I really don’t even understand what that is.</p>\n\n<p>As I witness some of our generation slowly begin to wake up, it gives me hope that we could be remembered for something great. I believe in soulmates and that there are certain people meant for you, at a certain time along your life path. I think, when you are your best (or close to it), you meet your unique counterpart. Who wouldn’t want to experience that?</p>\n\n<p>The more you focus on loving yourself and those around you who deserve it (and some who don’t), the more positive the vibes you are leaking out. I wish people would just realize how important love is, because love is powerful and it could save us from a world full of selfishness, hatred, and greed.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some reasons why I think people are giving up on love.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>*Speed Dating. *</em>This is basically what people do, trying to find their ‘one and only’ rapidly moving through people like there is no tomorrow. Where is the spontaneity in that? The romance? No where. Dating as a sport isn’t going to get you any closer to ‘the one’. Dating someone who isn’t right for you just for the sake of dating will lead you nowhere but straight into disaster. Work on loving who you are and bettering yourself everyday, then the right person for you will come along.</li>\n<li><em>*The Ego is Taking Over. *</em>Part of the ego is sometimes recognized as arrogance. Boy, does our generation have a sh*t ton of that. It’s all about status, money, and how many followers you have on Twitter. An overboard of selfies so a bunch of people you may or may not know can tell you how awesome you are. The other part of the ego is insecurity. Feeling insecure when you see a beautiful picture of someone else or jealousy of how someones lifestyle is displayed through imagery.</li>\n<li><em>*Lack of Respect For One’s Self. *</em>Sleeping around, posting half naked pictures, and pretending to be someone you are not is all just disrespecting yourself. Giving someone your mind, your body, and your soul is a beautiful experience and we suck the beauty right out of it. Sex is great and it is meant to be great, with the <em>right</em> person. A person who loves and respects you, not someone who just wants to feel great in the moment but for a *lifetime. *Wanna Netflix and chill? Nope, I want to turn off Netflix and make love, thank you very much.</li>\n<li><em>*The World is at Our Fingertips. *</em>Literally, by the click of a mouse we can instantly have anything we want. If we are hungry we can wait in a drive-thru for a few minutes or have it delivered to our doorsteps. Need clothes? Order them online!

It exists without favorite ones, without cursed ones; there are only the divine beings manifested by the Creator, and all of these beings are loved and cared for equally, deeply, and completely.</span>\n\n**Law of Lessons – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we **[reincarnate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation)** we do so to learn what is and is not like love.

One walks the divine circle until their lessons are learned.</span>\n\n**Law of Balance – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The objective in learning lessons is to achieve a sense of balance.  Imbalances are what drive your personal cycle of reincarnation.  For example, whatever you bring hate to, is what you reincarnate to, so that you might have the opportunity to achieve balance.  Because you can only truly understand a thing when you become that thing; ceasing judgement and the harboring of unrealistic expectations.</span>\n\n**Law of Expansion – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because everything in the universe is energy, the universe is constantly expanding from lower to higher vibrational levels.  And due to this constant expansion, change and growth are all but certain.  The universe grows by weaving its way through chaos, reorganization, and order in one long endless cycle of change and growth, executed in hopes of continuous improvement.</span>\n\n**Law of Love – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karma comes full circle with love.  The entire purpose of Karma is to propel your soul on a personal journey of reincarnation through the universe, eventually bringing all of us into a state of divine love, joy and awareness.

Change is a natural part of life, and with it comes a myriad of different emotions.  When we start to feel uncomfortable with where we are in life, or where we think we’re headed, it often means that we are at the crux of change, and how we cope with this process says a lot about us.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never fear change; change simply implies that you have to gain a new perspective or understanding.

Does anyone really know what they want out of life?  It’s a hard question to answer.

Finding your center allows you to align more with who you are, rather than who you want to be, and this is good for the mind and soul.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><em>*You start viewing adversity in life as opportunity to better understand yourself – *</em>One of the things I strive to do most in life is take away lessons and understanding from all of the random experiences that happen to me.  From each relationship, a better understanding of how to love.  From each friendship, a better understanding of how to be a true friend.  Things that cause us great pain and despair often provide a deeper understanding of ourselves.</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/feature_image_tempsignlate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-03-08 06:38:24","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-03-08 06:38:24","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-03-08 06:38:24","published_by":1},{"id":54,"uuid":"aef04eb8-954f-40dd-a1a4-16320a7eb0eb","title":"Soulmate or Life Partner, Do You Know the Difference?","slug":"soulmate-or-life-partner-do-you-know-the-difference","markdown":"\n**[Longing to find one’s soulmate](http://foreverconscious.com/why-do-we-seek-companionship)** is often the tale of many Disney films, romantic films, and fairy tales.

According to **[ForeverConscious](http://foreverconscious.com/the-difference-between-soulmates-and-life-partners)**, a soulmate is one who is aligned with your soul and is sent to challenge, awaken and stir different parts of your in order for your soul to transcend to higher levels of consciousness and awareness, and once the lesson has been learned, the two beings physically separate.\n\nA life partner is a companion and friend, a stable person who you can always rely on, trust, and depend on to help you through the trials of life.  You share a mutual love and respect for one another, always in sync, satisfying each others needs and desires.\n\nSoulmates appear in our lives at the exact moment when we need them.  When we are ready to learn one of the grand lessons in life, our soulmates are there to guide us toward the destiny we were meant to live.  Soulmate relationships typically do not stand the test of time, as they are typically too intense and possess a certain karmic energy necessary to close relationships once the lessons have been learned.\n\nThey are not always romantic partners, they can be friends or relatives.  You will, however, always feel a strong connection to these individuals, as you have a shared energy or a past life history with one another.\n\nOn the other hand, a life partner is someone who acts more as companion or friend.

Every relationship needs to have that spark or special quality that keeps the passion and love fueled and burning.  See what your Zodiac sign has to say about your needs in a relationship:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aries needs someone who is direct and up-front about things, as they don’t like to be waiting around on people.  They crave spontaneity and are impatient, so be up-front with them, never hide things from them and you’ll do just fine.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Taurus appreciates a gentle lover.  They’re looking for a civilized being who has taste and tact.  Rude words and an uninviting edge will quickly turn them off.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gemini needs to have contact with their lover at least a little bit everyday.  Regardless of medium, communication is key to a lasting relationship with a Gemini.  Don’t be afraid to shoot a quick text over to them for no other reason than you’re thinking about them.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cancer’s needs revolve around protection.

Competence and kindness rank high in the Virgo’s world, so if you’re trying to get on their good side, take the time to be the caring person they want you to be.  Showing compassion for less fortunate people or creatures goes a long way.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Libra enjoys smooth sailing and steady waters.

A Libra is quick to forgive as they appreciate all attempts and see past most shortcomings.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Scorpio values honesty and integrity in their partners.  They’re also drawn toward those they can feel keep a secret.  Also, as they are highly sexual beings, being good in bed also helps lure in a Scorpio.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius is huge on generosity.

This is true when it comes to good sex as well, always be able to give and receive.  </span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Capricorn is attracted to respect, a strong work ethic and those who are not lazy because they understand that a loving relationship is something that takes time and effort.  They don’t enjoy being taken for granted, but also don’t enjoy being praised too often.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aquarius loves exciting and experimental things, but what they value even more is someone who is fair and open-minded.  If their partner complains about petty things in life then there is no chance for them.  They like when their partner agrees with what they have to say.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Possibly the most sensitive of all the Zodiac signs, the Pisces needs a lover who is both open and sensitive.  They don’t enjoy people whose feelings are constantly hurt and they respond best to the lover that comforts them during times of duress.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships are no walk in the park, especially when it comes to navigating the differences between signs.  Every relationship needs to have that spark or special quality that keeps the passion and love fueled and burning.  See what your Zodiac sign has to say about your needs in a relationship:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Aries needs someone who is direct and up-front about things, as they don’t like to be waiting around on people.  They crave spontaneity and are impatient, so be up-front with them, never hide things from them and you’ll do just fine.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Taurus appreciates a gentle lover.  They’re looking for a civilized being who has taste and tact.  Rude words and an uninviting edge will quickly turn them off.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gemini needs to have contact with their lover at least a little bit everyday.  Regardless of medium, communication is key to a lasting relationship with a Gemini.  Don’t be afraid to shoot a quick text over to them for no other reason than you’re thinking about them.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cancer’s needs revolve around protection.  They enjoy feeling that they themselves are protected by their partner and that their partners feel protected by them.

This can lead you to being anxious about time constraints and deadlines.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also tend to stress about personal conflicts, whether you hurt someone’s feelings or can’t find a resolution to a fight; trust your gut and go with your instincts, they’ll guide you in the right direction.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Gemini dislikes people who are visibly dull or foolish.

Breathe deeply, feeling it in your stomach, as that’s where you feel most safe.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos stress out a lot when they find themselves out of control and not knowing what to do.  They also hate losing things and not being able to find them.  Love makes the Leo act the most crazy, turning the King of the Jungle into an insecure, mess of a person.

Allow people to know your boundaries and needs so that a winning solution for everyone can be reached.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius hates stagnation, so you’re prone to absolutely hating traffic.  You don’t enjoy any activities where you have to be on your best behavior to please someone else.

Any situations that leave you feeling vulnerable or exposed will be stressful.  Invasions of privacy or space can leave you feeling ill, as does a loud environment.

In order to create the space in which one communicates telepathically with an animal, one must first quiet the mind, focus on living presently, and open the heart.  Once you’ve done this, practice doing one or more of the practices below for at least a few minutes a day.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Animals mainly think in pictures and emotions.  So, when they’re trying to connect with you, they’ll often create a mental image or some type of emotion.  Communicating with animals isn’t like talking to a friend over the phone.  You will not ‘hear’ their words, necessarily, but rather different words will manifest in your own mind spontaneously as you receive their thoughts or feelings.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here are five practices for telepathy with animals:</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Pictorial Messages**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When trying to get your animal companion to do something for you, next time try forming a mental image of the action that you want them to do, and then focus on sending that image to them via ‘telepathic airwaves’.  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Like in those old beer commercials, where the dog fetches a beer for his master out of the fridge, picture them doing whatever it is you want them to do.  You’ll start to notice that they respond to these mental messages.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Sending Feelings**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Similar to the last practice, you’ll be trying to send your emotions or feelings to your animal companion.  To try this, instead of exclaiming ‘good boy!’, practice focusing more on the actual feeling of being happy or satisfied with your companion.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Once you’ve really built up this emotion of being pleased inside of you, send it off to them.  Practicing this will help you both send and receive messages from animals.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Make a Metaphor**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Being able to create different metaphors is vital to understanding metaphors that you might receive from an animal.  Metaphors are mental images that symbolically represent certain feelings, emotions, or ideas.  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, if I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, an image of Atlas holding the Earth on his shoulders might pop into my mind.  Practice creating different mental images of metaphors for the feelings you experience, as animals will often use these to try to speak to you.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Send Comfort**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In the same way that you would send a mental image or a feeling, sending comfort is one of the best ways to get through to an animal telepathically.  Focus on the animal’s suffering and then brainstorm all of the ways you can offer it comfort.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You can send feelings of being loved or pictures of you soothing them or petting them.  If the animal is near death you might send them images of how happy they’ll be in their new afterlife animal sanctuary.  Gather these thoughts and feelings, prepare them to be sent and then shoot them over to the animal in need.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">**Requests for Help**</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">While animals have no way of interpreting any sort of spoken message, they’re very apt at picking up on the emotions and feelings that lie behind them.  When a person asks for help, they typically expect a solution to be given in the form of a spoken answer, “you need to do this.”  Animals will not be able to answer questions like this.  </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Instead, focus on a current problem or concern that you have and then navigate your way through all of the different feelings and emotions that have motivated the question.  Use these feelings to build a statement instead of a question, acknowledge any images that come with it, and then telepathically send that statement (along with any emotions or pictures) to an animal, to yourself, to another person, or to your God.  </span>\n\n \n\n(h/t **[OM Times](http://omtimes.com/2015/06/telepathy-with-animals/4/)**)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span class=\"s1\">While it might seem far-fetched at first, Dr. Linda Bender says that telepathy between yourself and animals is possible and she’ll help you do it.

Metaphors are mental images that symbolically represent certain feelings, emotions, or ideas.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">For example, if I’m feeling overwhelmed in life, an image of Atlas holding the Earth on his shoulders might pop into my mind.  Practice creating different mental images of metaphors for the feelings you experience, as animals will often use these to try to speak to you.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Send Comfort</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">In the same way that you would send a mental image or a feeling, sending comfort is one of the best ways to get through to an animal telepathically.  Focus on the animal’s suffering and then brainstorm all of the ways you can offer it comfort.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">You can send feelings of being loved or pictures of you soothing them or petting them.  If the animal is near death you might send them images of how happy they’ll be in their new afterlife animal sanctuary.  Gather these thoughts and feelings, prepare them to be sent and then shoot them over to the animal in need.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Requests for Help</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">While animals have no way of interpreting any sort of spoken message, they’re very apt at picking up on the emotions and feelings that lie behind them.  When a person asks for help, they typically expect a solution to be given in the form of a spoken answer, “you need to do this.”  Animals will not be able to answer questions like this.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Instead, focus on a current problem or concern that you have and then navigate your way through all of the different feelings and emotions that have motivated the question.  Use these feelings to build a statement instead of a question, acknowledge any images that come with it, and then telepathically send that statement (along with any emotions or pictures) to an animal, to yourself, to another person, or to your God.  </span></p>\n\n<p>(h/t <strong><a href=\"http://omtimes.com/2015/06/telepathy-with-animals/4/\">OM Times</a></strong>)</p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/feature_image_temanplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-03-27 08:00:20","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-03-27 08:00:20","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-03-27 08:00:20","published_by":1},{"id":69,"uuid":"53ab5c7d-4d3b-43c9-a748-ea8eceed62a4","title":"5 Things That Lower Your Vibration and What To Do About Them","slug":"5-things-that-lower-your-vibration-and-what-to-do-about-them","markdown":"\n<span class=\"s1\">Everything that exists today is made of energy.

They can be quick-tempered and critical, but are typically at ease when in company and social settings.  They’re usually quite intellectual and enjoy notable popularity.</span>\n\n**Ox – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ox is known for being stoic and strong.  They face adversity head on and inspire confidence in others.  They handle their responsibilities methodically and often garner respect because of it.  They can come off as arrogant at times because they defend their interests with extreme determination, but this same determination is admirable as it founded in a sense of duty.</span>\n\n**Tigers – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tiger is highly sensitive and often turns to its emotions, allowing it to love deeply.  The Tiger needs to find the balance between their need for love, their strong competitive spirit, and their desire to dominate.  They’re well-suited for leadership, as they courageously face any and all challenges.</span>\n\n**Rabbits / Hare – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rabbits are well-liked people because of their affectionate and courteous nature.  They dislike drama, preferring to stay out of it.  They focus mainly on pursuits that make them happy, and would never deliberately hurt anyone.  Despite their fun-loving nature, they are usually quiet and reserved.</span>\n\n**Dragons – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragons are vibrant with energy and demonstrate a great charismatic presence, which can often come off as boisterous and loud occasionally.  They’re very talented people due to their high intelligence.  They enjoy demanding situations that provide them with opportunity to use all of their energies and talents to succeed.</span>\n\n**Snakes – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snakes are known for their wisdom and ability for profound thought.  They’re also quite charming and romantic.  Despite this quality for love, they are often loners and prefer secrecy.  This leads many snakes to be less socially popular than their peers, but that’s ok because the snake prefers its own company.</span>\n\n**Horses – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horse people prefer independence and hard work, which is often revealed in their characteristic egotism.  They possess great verbal acuity and a high intellectual capacity, however, providing them with the opportunity to be quite popular.  They will commit to hard work and success as long as the work they are doing is not seen as beneath them.</span>\n\n**Sheep – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sheep are charming and likable folks, even if they are reserved.  A sheep person possesses a love for nature, art, and culture, and often commands a great deal of creativity themselves.  They can be timid, but are generally self-confident.  They are most fulfilled when in a relationship that provides security.</span>\n\n**Monkeys – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intelligent and energetic, the Monkey touts a magnetic personality that draws people in.  They are often viewed as eccentric due to their quick wit and easy talent for finding humor in every situation.  </span>\n\n**Roosters – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roosters are known for their inclination toward industry and hard work, as well as their ability to easily express their views.  They do not like to share the spotlight with others, as they view their own opinions, and their right to share them, as highly important.  They can be very true and loyal in relationships, and have potential for success in their careers due to their high standards.</span>\n\n**Dogs – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dog people are notorious for their honesty and loyalty in relationships.  When they choose to tackle a new pursuit, they give it their all, whether it be in their career or their hobbies.  Dogs have sharp tongues that feel the need to criticize often, partly due to the fact that they adhere strongly to principles of justice and fairness.</span>\n\n**Pigs – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pig people make wonderful companions because of their ability to be sincere, kind, and tolerant.  They use their intellect to set high goals and then achieve them.  They have great sense of humor and possess great wit.  Their desire for social harmony allows them to overlook the faults in people, but this is also their greatest vulnerability, as they expect others to do the same.</span>\n\n \n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Find your birth year on the chart above to see which animal is associated with your birth year, then read below to see which characteristics you inherit from your Chinese Zodiac sign:</p>\n\n<p><em>*Rats – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rats are charming and thoughtful individuals, touting strong and vivid imaginations, and generosity in relationships that are important to them.

Maybe you’re the type to sit in the corner and brood or maybe you’re the type to start yelling and causing a big scene.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anger is multi-faceted emotion and there are endless ways to express it.  But your Zodiac sign also has a lot to say about how you handle yourself when you’re feeling pissed off. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is each Zodiac sign’s way of expressing anger:</span>\n\n**Aries (March 21 – April 19) | Temper tantrums**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aries are notorious for being firecrackers, and when it comes to anger, they’re prone to sudden outbursts.  They don’t like to sugarcoat things for anyone, so if they’re upset with you, you’ll know about it.</span>\n\n**Taurus (April 20 – May 20) | Build up and explode**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus is a dangerous person to upset, as they won’t initially let you know that they’re mad at you.  They let their emotions simmer, subtly trying to give hints that you’ve upset them before letting all of their boiling anger come flowing out like an erupting volcano.</span>\n\n**Gemini (May 21 – June 20) | Verbal expression**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Geminis are so obsessed with talking, it should come as no surprise that their anger is unleashed via their sharp tongues.  They like to scream, shout and throw insults that cut to the very core of a person’s being.</span>\n\n**Cancer (June 21 – July 22) | Kind of all over the place**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cancer doesn’t openly express their anger until they’ve taken all that they can handle.  First they sulk, then they become passive-aggressive, and then they become reclusive.  If no one has taken the time to try and remedy this situation, they go from crying to intense outbursts of anger.</span>\n\n**Leo (July 23 – August 22) | RAAAWR!**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Leo is quite apt at expressing anger.  When they’re pissed off, they love to shout and yell while becoming an intense storm of anger and fury.  They swear like sailors and use vulgar language during their outbursts.</span>\n\n**Virgo (August 23 – September 22) | Brood and brood**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos don’t particularly enjoy letting their anger out, so what usually happens is they hold all of it in for as long as they can until something tiny lights their fuse, blowing them into orbit.  Their anger is usually never about something immediate that happened, but rather something that happened long ago.</span>\n\n**Libra (September 23 – October 22) | Seething behind the scenes**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libras despise confrontation and hate showing their anger because they think it makes them less attractive.  They try not to let their angry emotions get to them, but sometimes they do and they will lose their cool.</span>\n\n**Scorpio (October 23 – November 21) | We are the fury**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to get the Scorpio fired up, but should you somehow achieve this feat, be prepared for a venomous wrath.  Scorpios are adept at destroying a person with verbal onslaughts and looks that could kill, and they’re not quick to forgive or forget what you’ve done.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) | One big ball of fire**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius has no fear of turning it up to 11.  If you piss them off they’ll get rid of you in a heartbeat.  Try to distract them from their anger, as they will often lose sight of why they were even upset in the first place.</span>\n\n**Capricorn (December 22 – January 19) | Destroy everything you touch**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Capricorn isn’t likely to express anger until their threshold has been reached.  Once it has been reached though, they’re likely to want to break something, like the spirit of the person who has wronged them or that lamp in the corner over there.  </span>\n\n**Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) | Let it go, let it gooo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Sagittarius has no chill, then the Aquarius has all of the chill.  When they’re upset they’ll simply disengage with everyone around them and go for a drive, or walk around for a bit until they’re not upset anymore.  If they can’t seem to let it go, they’ll eventually lose their temper and dump all of their negative emotions on you.</span>\n\n**Pisces (February 19 – March) | Up, down and all around**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pisces aren’t ones to typically get very angry, which makes it all the worse when they finally do.  However, the only person they ever seem to get upset with is themselves.  Their rage includes violent, self-destructive behaviors, often requiring a bit of healing after they’re done with an outburst.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone likes to express their disappointments, frustrations and anger in different ways.

They like to scream, shout and throw insults that cut to the very core of a person’s being.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer (June 21 – July 22) | Kind of all over the place</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cancer doesn’t openly express their anger until they’ve taken all that they can handle.  First they sulk, then they become passive-aggressive, and then they become reclusive.  If no one has taken the time to try and remedy this situation, they go from crying to intense outbursts of anger.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Leo (July 23 – August 22) | RAAAWR!</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Leo is quite apt at expressing anger.  When they’re pissed off, they love to shout and yell while becoming an intense storm of anger and fury.  They swear like sailors and use vulgar language during their outbursts.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Virgo (August 23 – September 22) | Brood and brood</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos don’t particularly enjoy letting their anger out, so what usually happens is they hold all of it in for as long as they can until something tiny lights their fuse, blowing them into orbit.  Their anger is usually never about something immediate that happened, but rather something that happened long ago.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Libra (September 23 – October 22) | Seething behind the scenes</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Libras despise confrontation and hate showing their anger because they think it makes them less attractive.  They try not to let their angry emotions get to them, but sometimes they do and they will lose their cool.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Scorpio (October 23 – November 21) | We are the fury</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to get the Scorpio fired up, but should you somehow achieve this feat, be prepared for a venomous wrath.  Scorpios are adept at destroying a person with verbal onslaughts and looks that could kill, and they’re not quick to forgive or forget what you’ve done.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) | One big ball of fire</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius has no fear of turning it up to 11.  If you piss them off they’ll get rid of you in a heartbeat.  Try to distract them from their anger, as they will often lose sight of why they were even upset in the first place.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Capricorn (December 22 – January 19) | Destroy everything you touch</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Capricorn isn’t likely to express anger until their threshold has been reached.  Once it has been reached though, they’re likely to want to break something, like the spirit of the person who has wronged them or that lamp in the corner over there.  </span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) | Let it go, let it gooo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Sagittarius has no chill, then the Aquarius has all of the chill.  When they’re upset they’ll simply disengage with everyone around them and go for a drive, or walk around for a bit until they’re not upset anymore.  If they can’t seem to let it go, they’ll eventually lose their temper and dump all of their negative emotions on you.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pisces (February 19 – March) | Up, down and all around</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pisces aren’t ones to typically get very angry, which makes it all the worse when they finally do.  However, the only person they ever seem to get upset with is themselves.  Their rage includes violent, self-destructive behaviors, often requiring a bit of healing after they’re done with an outburst.</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/feature_image_temhcsdplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-01 00:35:11","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-01 00:35:11","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-04-01 00:35:11","published_by":1},{"id":73,"uuid":"0c2d1ea8-b911-4213-bec5-8a07e0e82bf0","title":"5 Great Reasons to STOP Throwing Away Your Avocado Seeds","slug":"5-great-reasons-to-stop-throwing-away-your-avocado-seeds","markdown":"\n \n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The word ‘**[superfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfood)**’ gets tossed around a lot these days to describe foods that are supposedly really healthy for you.

Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this User Agreement.\n2. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n\n**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**. This User Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this User Agreement shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.\n\n**Modification**. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this User Agreement, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you notice through the Services, via e-mail or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check this User Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to this User Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n**Entire Agreement and Severability**. This User Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of this User Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this User Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder\n\n**Force Majeure**. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.\n\n**Assignment**. This User Agreement is personal to you, and is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.\n\n**Agency**. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this User Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.\n\n**Notices**. Unless otherwise specified in this User Agreement, all notices under this User Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.\n\n**No Waiver**. Our failure to enforce any part of this User Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of this User Agreement. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with this User Agreement to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.\n\n**Headings**.

As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this User Agreement.  \n2. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n\n**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**.

Highly ambitious and creative, the Aries is almost always thrusted into a position of leadership.  You’re also very spontaneous and never miss an opportunity to adventure with those you care about.</span>\n\n**Taurus – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practical artist.  The Taurus is known for its loyalty, which is why their friendships will last a lifetime.  You’ve seen your BFFs through the darkest of times and never leave people hanging.  Your artistic side of you comes out in your work.</span>\n\n**Gemini – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firecracker.  Geminis are the free spirits that are unforgettable.  Your laughter is contagious and you never let anyone tone you down.  You’re good at adapting to new environments and are not afraid to voice your opinion.</span>\n\n**Cancer – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have the biggest of hearts.  Crabs tend to have an icy, hard outer layer, but are known for their love.  When you give love, you give it all, showering your partner with respect and admiration because you see the best in them.  You’re also very empathetic and in tune with your emotions.</span>\n\n**Leo – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The energy and passion of the sun.  Leos radiate positive vibes, lifting the moods and energies of those around them.  You’re always on board for a good time with friends.  You can also be very blunt sometimes, but it’s necessary.  Telling your friends what they need to hear when they need to hear it is a good thing.</span>\n\n**Virgo – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intelligent introvert.  Virgos are highly observant, allowing them to read people like the Sunday newspaper.  Your friends count on you in a variety of different situations because of how reliable and resourceful you are.  You don’t like to show off because overachieving comes naturally to you.</span>\n\n**Libra – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charming peacemaker.  Libras are infamous for being the most dateable of the zodiac because of their highly romantic nature.  They put a lot of thought and effort into showing their significant others that they care.  Libras listen and give advice, which is why their friends come to them for help with their problems.</span>\n\n**Scorpio – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Scorpio is bold.  Unafraid of failure, the Scorpio takes risks without fear.  They’re good decision-makers because of their intuitive nature.  Getting work done on time is not hard because of how well you focus.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re the adventurous one.  Being timid is not your thing, as Sagittariuses are brave adventurers.  Spontaneous backpacking trips through foreign countries aren’t unusual and you have a heart for people, which is when you show your compassion.</span>\n\n**Capricorn – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wise alpha.  Capricorns are highly ambitious, which is where the alpha trait derives from.  There is no fear when it comes to making those big leaps in life.  Go for it and give it your best.  </span>\n\n**Aquarius – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old soul.  Aquarians gain their notoriety from their sentimental friendliness, meaning, like the Taurus, they make lasting friendships.  Your big imagination contributes to your unique way of thinking and your nerdy sense of humor.</span>\n\n**Pisces – **<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The compassionate one.  Pisces can get a bad rep because of their highly sensitive nature, but it’s definitely not a bad thing.  It’s an essential part of your personality because you’re always there to help when someone needs it.  You have a kind heart and a creative mind, leading you to inspire others.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believing in the stars is something that might seem a bit far fetched for some, but for those of us who look to them for wisdom and guidance, they’re more than just dazzling lights in the night sky.

You’re good at adapting to new environments and are not afraid to voice your opinion.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Cancer – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have the biggest of hearts.  Crabs tend to have an icy, hard outer layer, but are known for their love.  When you give love, you give it all, showering your partner with respect and admiration because you see the best in them.  You’re also very empathetic and in tune with your emotions.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Leo – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The energy and passion of the sun.  Leos radiate positive vibes, lifting the moods and energies of those around them.  You’re always on board for a good time with friends.  You can also be very blunt sometimes, but it’s necessary.  Telling your friends what they need to hear when they need to hear it is a good thing.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Virgo – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intelligent introvert.  Virgos are highly observant, allowing them to read people like the Sunday newspaper.  Your friends count on you in a variety of different situations because of how reliable and resourceful you are.  You don’t like to show off because overachieving comes naturally to you.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Libra – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charming peacemaker.

Getting work done on time is not hard because of how well you focus.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Sagittarius – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re the adventurous one.

Spontaneous backpacking trips through foreign countries aren’t unusual and you have a heart for people, which is when you show your compassion.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Capricorn – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wise alpha.  Capricorns are highly ambitious, which is where the alpha trait derives from.  There is no fear when it comes to making those big leaps in life.

Aquarians gain their notoriety from their sentimental friendliness, meaning, like the Taurus, they make lasting friendships.  Your big imagination contributes to your unique way of thinking and your nerdy sense of humor.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>*Pisces – *</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The compassionate one.  Pisces can get a bad rep because of their highly sensitive nature, but it’s definitely not a bad thing.  It’s an essential part of your personality because you’re always there to help when someone needs it.  You have a kind heart and a creative mind, leading you to inspire others.</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/feature_image_tearegdfmplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-04-24 06:56:43","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-04-24 06:57:23","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-04-24 06:56:43","published_by":1},{"id":89,"uuid":"1bc3606e-6ec5-41ed-8acf-7a881927b858","title":"The 4 Types of Negative People To Avoid At All Cost","slug":"the-4-types-of-negative-people-to-avoid-at-all-cost","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we progress through this journey called life we will allow a number of different people to come into our lives, whether it be as friends, business partners, lovers, or whatever else.

They would leave her bed-ridden, incapacitated, and reeling from the sudden, sharp jolts of pain in her head.  While her migraines were undoubtedly a bit more severe than your average, she is not alone in her suffering.  </span>\n\nOver 36 million people in the United States are affected by migraines, which is close to one out of every ten people!\n\nWhile a migraine might give you an excuse to get out of certain responsibilities for the day, the intense pain doesn’t let you enjoy much of anything.  The constant throbbing and pain can push even the most grounded people off of their game, as their duration can change wildly; they can last anywhere from four to seventy-two hours.\n\nSymptoms include nausea, vomiting, numbness, tingling sensations, dizziness and sensitivity to lights, noises and smells.\n\nMigraines are believed to be caused by a wide variety of different factors, including stress, alcohol consumption, allergies and deficiencies in the body.  However, it has been seen that the biggest indicator of migraines is dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance.\n\nElectrolytes support and regulate nerve function, they regulate the cardiovascular system, and they regulate muscle function, making them pretty important to a healthy body.  As migraines are an inflammatory response, Magnesium can also be beneficial when seeking relief from a migraine.\n\nThe recipe to soothe your aching head is actually pretty simple:\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 Cup of Water</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon Juice from One Whole Lemon</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Teaspoons of Sea Salt</span>\n\nTry to obtain high quality salt, like pink Himalayan sea salt.  This incredibly pure salt has more than eighty different trace minerals, including the aforementioned Magnesium.

They would leave her bed-ridden, incapacitated, and reeling from the sudden, sharp jolts of pain in her head.  While her migraines were undoubtedly a bit more severe than your average, she is not alone in her suffering.  </span></p>\n\n<p>Over 36 million people in the United States are affected by migraines, which is close to one out of every ten people!</p>\n\n<p>While a migraine might give you an excuse to get out of certain responsibilities for the day, the intense pain doesn’t let you enjoy much of anything.  The constant throbbing and pain can push even the most grounded people off of their game, as their duration can change wildly; they can last anywhere from four to seventy-two hours.</p>\n\n<p>Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, numbness, tingling sensations, dizziness and sensitivity to lights, noises and smells.</p>\n\n<p>Migraines are believed to be caused by a wide variety of different factors, including stress, alcohol consumption, allergies and deficiencies in the body.  However, it has been seen that the biggest indicator of migraines is dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance.</p>\n\n<p>Electrolytes support and regulate nerve function, they regulate the cardiovascular system, and they regulate muscle function, making them pretty important to a healthy body.  As migraines are an inflammatory response, Magnesium can also be beneficial when seeking relief from a migraine.</p>\n\n<p>The recipe to soothe your aching head is actually pretty simple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 Cup of Water</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon Juice from One Whole Lemon</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Teaspoons of Sea Salt</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Try to obtain high quality salt, like pink Himalayan sea salt.  This incredibly pure salt has more than eighty different trace minerals, including the aforementioned Magnesium.  When you ingest these minerals quickly, the serotonin levels in your body increase, which directly helps relieve pain and inflammation.</p>\n\n<p>While there isn’t a ton of research that readily proves this recipe 100% effective, electrolyte solutions are often used by medical professionals when treating patients suffering from migraines.</p>\n\n<p>It might be an old remedy, but there’s a reason that people use it.

They’re the perfect partners in a relationship, and here are five reasons why:</span>\n\n**Their love is like no other love you’ve ever experienced**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll quickly learn that you’ll have a hard time trying not to fall for the Taurus fast and hard.  Their passion and sympathy shows how colorful and caring they are, illustrating their deep commitment to the people they choose to keep in their life.  They always go the extra mile to make their partners feel loved.</span>\n\n**They want to really *****know***** you**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus excels in figuring out what makes people get excited, whatever it may be.  They’re genuinely interested in what’s happening in your life, meaning it can be hard to hide things as they are very observant.  If you’re having an off day, they’ll pick up on it instantly.</span>\n\n**They’re beyond loyal**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a Taurus finds his or herself in a committed relationship, they’re in it for the long haul.  Devotion is no trouble for the Taurus and they’re the best at following through on promises.  Their passion comes out once they feel safe and secure in a relationship, so give and you shall receive.</span>\n\n**They feel *****everything***\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taurus are not typically fake or phony people, as they value being genuine to those around them.  They often love deeply, meaning they’ll show their love interest tremendous kindness and generosity.

This is the stage when most people want to have children and rear them together, as their bond becomes strengthened.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The individuals start making decisions based around the couple, rather than the individual.

You become resentful and angry over the littlest things, you feel less loved and intimate, and you want out.

When we forget that we are shadows of our souls, we forget what it means to truly be ourselves, where we truly come from and how to be all that we can be.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When this happens, it’s okay, because our souls have got our backs, and they’ll always be there to guide us along by reminding us of these five simple life truths:</span>\n\n**You are where you are supposed to be, do not fret**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re working your way through life, making big decisions, and choosing which paths to take at those monumental forks in the road, your soul knows that regardless of which choices you make, at the end of the day everything happens for a reason.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embrace where you are at this moment in life and know that everything will work out in the end.</span>\n\n**Acknowledge impermanence**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the greatest lessons to be learned in life is that most everything in life has an expiration date on it.  Just as we are not permanent fixtures on this planet, pretty much everything else is not permanent either.  So, recognize when there is good in your life and when there is bad in your life, and know that neither one will stay with you forever.</span>\n\n**To succeed, you only need look inward**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who meditate regularly will tell you that all of your problems can be solved by simply channeling your inner awareness.  When you are down on your luck or struggling to find your stride, look inside and listen to your soul.  It knows that you are strong enough, compassionate and loving enough, and courageous enough to take on any endeavor.</span>\n\n**You’re perfectly okay as you are right now**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing who you are for reasons that are not true to yourself is not healthy growth.

Recognizing emotionally abusive habits are key to stopping them altogether.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five signs that emotional abuse is taking place:</span>\n\n**Being publicly shamed**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, degrading someone’s worth is a poor and unacceptable behavior, and doing it in a public setting makes it that much worse.  Helpful criticism is one thing, but insulting a person due to shortcomings or mistakes is inhuman and wrong.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being publicly shamed increases the emotional damage done tenfold.  </span>\n\n**Constant Disapproval**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your partner is seemingly never satisfied (or visibly dissatisfied) with everything you do, this habit can quickly turn into a form of emotional abuse.  You start to question everything that you do, and even change your way of doing things to try to please your partner.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually you will learn that there is nothing you can do or change to make them happy, leading to a degenerated sense of self-worth.</span>\n\n**Using jokes to mask insults**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel like most people have a friend or know someone who uses jokes and half-truths to subtly insult or demean others.  Being able to laugh at yourself is a good trait to have, but allowing someone to degrade you in a way that seems affable is not okay.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes they don’t even realize they’re doing it, however, that does not make it acceptable behavior.</span>\n\n**Seeking retribution**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone makes mistakes and messes up every now and then, it’s part of being human.  So, actively seeking a form of ‘revenge’ for something that your partner did wrong is unhealthy.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imposing guilt, lashing out, or simply ignoring your partner out of spite is not fair to either person.  Mistakes will be made, learn how to handle your emotions effectively.</span>\n\n**Constant attempts at belittlement**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is easily one of the worst forms of emotional abuse.  If your partner always takes the time to belittle you and make you feel inferior to them, you should probably move on.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These people love to remind you just how lucky you are to even be with them, or how unworthy of their love you are.

In contrast, these feelings were not associated with the same degree of sleep disruption in men.”</span></p>\n\n<p>So guys, if you want a happy, healthy girlfriend or wife, make sure they’re getting the sleep they need to keep those high-functioning, complex brains of theirs well rested.</p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/feature_image_tehgggghhmplate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-05-29 07:49:20","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-05-29 07:49:20","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-05-29 07:49:20","published_by":1},{"id":136,"uuid":"7f7c858e-f195-4571-9f19-38f1b79db2c6","title":"5 Forgotten Truths to Remember During Hard Times","slug":"5-forgotten-truths-to-remember-during-hard-times","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nature of life is simply that there will be good times and there will undoubtedly be bad times; it’s how we react, how we compose ourselves during these times that come to define our true character.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we find ourselves in these unfortunate situations, we can let them take hold of us and destroy us, or we can use them to fortify ourselves, to bolster our being.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These five forgotten truths are empowering–they’ll help you remain strong and wise during troubled times.</span>\n\n**Pain is a natural part of life, it helps you grow**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could be argued that pain is </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> most natural part of human life.

Some worries for me include: my student loans, making enough money to support myself, making enough money to have fun, having enough time to do the things I like to do, keeping my relationships healthy and happy, keeping myself happy.. The list goes on and on.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worrying about things does absolutely nothing for us.  Think about it.  Are you achieving anything when you sit and stress over things that have yet to happen?  Worry does not relieve the burdens of tomorrow, it only limits what you are capable of today.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, take action, be assertive, be proactive, and stop worrying about these five things immediately:</span>\n\n**Challenges**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every single challenge you come across in life is an opportunity for growth.  What would life be without challenges?  They’re what keep our lives interesting, and we gain a sense of self by overcoming them.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we landed a man on the moon, we did it because of the challenge.  To say that we did it.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognize challenges for what they are and use them to grow stronger, to live more fully.</span>\n\n**Poor circumstances that are out of your control**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know that even during the seemingly darkest of times, you still have the ability to not only succeed, but to thrive.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all capable of extraordinary things, but many of us never do them because we have excuses.  The economy is bad, the weather is crappy outside today, etc.  The only thing that you have control over at the end of the day is your mind, so use it to overcome.</span>\n\n**What everyone else is doing**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I read somewhere recently that people who were not on social media tended to be less depressed than those who were because they weren’t constantly comparing their lives to others’.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let the image of others succeeding and doing well deter you from chasing your own happiness.

Some worries for me include: my student loans, making enough money to support myself, making enough money to have fun, having enough time to do the things I like to do, keeping my relationships healthy and happy, keeping myself happy.. The list goes on and on.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worrying about things does absolutely nothing for us.  Think about it.  Are you achieving anything when you sit and stress over things that have yet to happen?  Worry does not relieve the burdens of tomorrow, it only limits what you are capable of today.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, take action, be assertive, be proactive, and stop worrying about these five things immediately:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every single challenge you come across in life is an opportunity for growth.  What would life be without challenges?  They’re what keep our lives interesting, and we gain a sense of self by overcoming them.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we landed a man on the moon, we did it because of the challenge.  To say that we did it.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognize challenges for what they are and use them to grow stronger, to live more fully.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Poor circumstances that are out of your control</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Know that even during the seemingly darkest of times, you still have the ability to not only succeed, but to thrive.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all capable of extraordinary things, but many of us never do them because we have excuses.  The economy is bad, the weather is crappy outside today, etc.  The only thing that you have control over at the end of the day is your mind, so use it to overcome.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>What everyone else is doing</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I read somewhere recently that people who were not on social media tended to be less depressed than those who were because they weren’t constantly comparing their lives to others’.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let the image of others succeeding and doing well deter you from chasing your own happiness.  They are encouraging you to do the same with your life as they are doing with theirs.

Essentially, it is your state of mind.</span>\n\n**Hard to believe?**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, this knowledge at face value will have most people skeptical, as we in the Western world have average lifespans of about 70-85 years.

Also, they aren’t consuming refined sugars or flours, fatty meats, genetically modified foods, or the typical junk foods we like to binge on every now and then.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, they spend almost all of their time in nature, perfecting their breathing techniques and meditating, practices that have been shown to boost mental, physical and emotional wellbeing.  And finally, they get proper sleep and spend time in the sun, something that we all typically refer to as “vacation” nowadays.</span>\n\nTreating our bodies right is the first step to living a long, happy and healthy life.

This man taught him Qigong exercises and the diet that would help Li to live for extended periods of time. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But on his deathbed, Li is quoted saying, “I have done all that I have to do in this world.”  </span></p>\n\n<p><strong>The secret to perpetual health</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Li’s only advice when asked about his secret to a long life was this: “Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise, walk sprightly like a pigeon and sleep like a dog.”  These were the same words Li gave Wu Pei-Fu, the warlord who invited Li to his home, so that he might learn his ways.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Li believed that looking inward, working to create a sense of calm and peacefulness through meditation and breathing techniques were the secret to incredible health.  Essentially, it is your state of mind.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hard to believe?</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, this knowledge at face value will have most people skeptical, as we in the Western world have average lifespans of about 70-85 years.  The difference that we must keep in mind when pondering these ideas is that not everyone on this planet has devoted themselves to a 9 to 5 working world lifestyle.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They aren’t plagued with debt, they aren’t living in crowded polluted cities, and they’re using their bodies to work regularly.  Also, they aren’t consuming refined sugars or flours, fatty meats, genetically modified foods, or the typical junk foods we like to binge on every now and then.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to mention, they spend almost all of their time in nature, perfecting their breathing techniques and meditating, practices that have been shown to boost mental, physical and emotional wellbeing.  And finally, they get proper sleep and spend time in the sun, something that we all typically refer to as “vacation” nowadays.</span></p>\n\n<p>Treating our bodies right is the first step to living a long, happy and healthy life.  We just have to be disciplined and determined.

Also, they think they’re the center of the universe.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Virgo is the highly judgmental and pessimistic perfectionist.  Their keen sense for attention to detail keeps them busy in a world full of imperfection.  And they can be drama queens when things aren’t going their way.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t hold your breath for the Libra–they like to take their sweet time weighing each and every option before committing to anything.  They’re fascinated with pretty things, which is why they spend so much time getting ready before doing anything.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Scorpio can hold a grudge like no one’s business.  They will make you regret ever wronging them.  They’re master manipulators, pulling strings here and there to get what they want.  And, they enjoy brooding over the sorrowful things in life.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being honest is good to a point, but the Sagittarians often take it too far.  They don’t like to sugarcoat things, meaning they’re blunt and straight to the point, even when they shouldn’t be.

When the root chakra becomes imbalanced, the other chakras suffer as well. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting at the base of our spines, the root chakra is connected to our hips, thighs, knees and feet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re unsure as to whether or not your root chakra is healthy and balanced, see if you suffer from any of the symptoms below:</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an eating disorder, trouble with constipation, or issues with the knees, feet or prostate gland</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re struggling from financial hardship</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any family issues that might be holding you or the family back</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feelings of anger or greed</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any co-dependence you have on another person</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feelings of depression or fear</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extreme laziness</span>\n\n**And the 7 great ways to rebalance and strengthen the Root Chakra**\n\n1. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use oils that are known for their ability to improve the root chakra’s health.  Oils like cedar wood, myrrh, and patchouli.  A few drops on the bottoms of your feet will work great.</span>\n2. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practicing reflexology and aromatherapy.  Attention paid specifically to the feet helps the root chakra to move.</span>\n3. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spend as much time outside as possible.

Heartbreak affects everyone differently, and your zodiac sign has a lot to do with that.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a bit of insight as to how each sign handles the pain of heartbreak, so that you might grow a little easier:</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting close to people is difficult for you, so when you do fall, you fall hard; which makes breaking up that much harder.  You’re not one to outwardly express the pain you’re feeling because you don’t like feeling vulnerable, so you stay busy and speak only to those who are close to you.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re likely to fully embrace the sadness and sorrow accompanied with most breakups, but you do so because you are not worried about being vulnerable or showing ‘weakness.’  You know that to fully heal you must finish your grieving.</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Aries gets hurt, they tend to look to their friends for support because of how social and outgoing they are.  Aries like to stay busy when they’re hurting; this lets them cover their pain with work and activities, pretending as if it hasn’t phased them.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus struggles at times to adequately express how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking.  You’re quick to be set off as you occasionally let your emotions flare up, but you have only kindness in your heart, and want someone who loves as deeply as you do.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gemini tend to live in the moment, so a failed relationship or parting of ways is simply water under the bridge.  They like to focus on what’s happening </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead of what happened yesterday.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancers fall back on their career or work during times of emotional duress because they are natural leaders and enjoy working.  You like to hide your sensitive side, not letting your personal life and work life intersect.  And your friends are always the focus after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos are traditionally both loyal and faithful people, enjoying passionate relationships with their partners.  Because of this, they are often shocked when their partner wishes to separate.  Leos will undoubtedly be hurt, but are also very understanding, wishing their partners the best as they move in a different direction.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos struggle to commit to one person, meaning they take breakups pretty hard.  But that doesn’t mean they’ll stay down for long.  They’re usually the first ones to be back in the dating scene, doing their best to move on–which they will.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The usually optimistic and upbeat Libra doesn’t stay hurt for long.  You might even be willing to stay friends with your former partner.  You will most likely spend most of your time with friends and family after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scorpios are quick to become reclusive, wanting to deal with their emotions by themselves.  They don’t like others seeing how hurt they are, so they simply pretend that they’re not.  You’ll likely try to stay busy to avoid thinking about it.  Scorpios are very difficult to love, but they are also the most sensitive.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius, being the carefree and lighthearted creatures that they are, tend to shrug off most breakups or separations.  That’s because the easiest way to deal with anything is to laugh, even when things are tough or sad.  But it’s a trait that the next person will absolutely love.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns take time to let people into their lives, but it’s always worth it because they are the best people to love.  Anyone who has broken up with you will come to regret it.  The Capricorn simply needs to give him or herself time to heal after a nasty breakup, even if it might take a lot of it.</span>\n\nh/t [**Puckermob**](http://www.puckermob.com/relationships/the-ways-you-deal-with-heartbreak-based-on-your-zodiac-sign)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re going through a tough time and have had to separate from your partner recently, you might be left feeling lost and confused.

I’d been quite happy and carefree the week before, so why the sudden despair and feelings of uncertainty?  As it would turn out, my girlfriend had been stressing out immensely, thinking about the upcoming changes in both of our lives.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was unknowingly picking up on all of the energy and negativity that she was feeling, and because much of it revolved around me and our relationship, she was unknowingly directing all of that negative energy at me.  When this happens, the person being sent the energy often cannot tell the difference between their own natural thoughts and these thoughts that are being sent to them, which causes even more confusion.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes people are unknowingly psychically attacking someone, while other times they can be doing it on purpose.  It’s important to recognize when you’re being attacked and what you can do to stop it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five tips for deflecting psychic attacks:</span>\n\n**Ask for help from friends, healers and mentors**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not sure where your negative energies, thoughts and feelings are coming from, it can be helpful for your friends and family to bring you into their positive thoughts and feelings.  Don’t be afraid to ask them to think about you during their prayers, meditations and healing practices.</span>\n\n**Channel your thoughts elsewhere**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might take some time, but you will ultimately learn to do it.  Whenever you find yourself vulnerable, thinking negative and poisonous things about yourself, a thing or a person, try focusing those thoughts on something constructive or useful.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a list of goals or positive things you wish for in your life is helpful when picking out something to channel your energy to.</span>\n\n**Focus on the good things in your life**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychic attacks often focus on the vulnerabilities that you have, seeking to exploit the darkness inside of you.  When you feel this happening, take yourself to the happy moments of your life and spend some time in the light.</span>\n\n**Stay consistent with healthy habits and rituals**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychic attacks also work by throwing off your balance.  Losing that balance in your life makes it easier for negativity and darkness to overcome the positivity.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortify your balance by keeping consistent with the different aspects of your life, like sleep, diet, exercise and self-reflection.</span>\n\n**Try not to retaliate**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people attack you they are opening themselves up to vulnerability.  While our energies have no limits, our attention is finite.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you spend more time focusing your attention on attacking someone else, you are effectively taking away the attention that you should be spending on yourself, working to create the healthy world that you want.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past couple of days I’d been having these crazy bouts of insecurity, confusion and sadness, and I could not for the life of me understand why.

When this happens, the person being sent the energy often cannot tell the difference between their own natural thoughts and these thoughts that are being sent to them, which causes even more confusion.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes people are unknowingly psychically attacking someone, while other times they can be doing it on purpose.  It’s important to recognize when you’re being attacked and what you can do to stop it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five tips for deflecting psychic attacks:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ask for help from friends, healers and mentors</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not sure where your negative energies, thoughts and feelings are coming from, it can be helpful for your friends and family to bring you into their positive thoughts and feelings.  Don’t be afraid to ask them to think about you during their prayers, meditations and healing practices.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Channel your thoughts elsewhere</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might take some time, but you will ultimately learn to do it.  Whenever you find yourself vulnerable, thinking negative and poisonous things about yourself, a thing or a person, try focusing those thoughts on something constructive or useful.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a list of goals or positive things you wish for in your life is helpful when picking out something to channel your energy to.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Focus on the good things in your life</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychic attacks often focus on the vulnerabilities that you have, seeking to exploit the darkness inside of you.  When you feel this happening, take yourself to the happy moments of your life and spend some time in the light.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stay consistent with healthy habits and rituals</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Psychic attacks also work by throwing off your balance.  Losing that balance in your life makes it easier for negativity and darkness to overcome the positivity.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortify your balance by keeping consistent with the different aspects of your life, like sleep, diet, exercise and self-reflection.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Try not to retaliate</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people attack you they are opening themselves up to vulnerability.  While our energies have no limits, our attention is finite.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you spend more time focusing your attention on attacking someone else, you are effectively taking away the attention that you should be spending on yourself, working to create the healthy world that you want.</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/feature_image_tem45245454plate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-07-07 07:29:56","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-07-07 07:29:56","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-07-07 07:29:56","published_by":1},{"id":185,"uuid":"153dff94-93d8-415e-9723-231db6fcf3c6","title":"5 Negative Thought Patterns You Need To Drop Now","slug":"5-negative-thought-patterns-you-need-to-drop-now","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negative thought patterns can easily turn a good day into an absolutely terrible day, especially for those of us with anxiety.

Ask them questions about their world, how it makes sense to them, and what they think about themselves.

Researchers have said, “even though most parents and caretakers say that their children being caring is a top priority, often children aren’t hearing that message.”  Tell them that you want them to be nice and caring.

Try going through these processes with them, showing them how to think critically along the way.  For example, if they want to quit the sport they’ve been playing.  Ask them how their decision will affect the other members of the team and whether or not their quitting will help anything.</span>\n\n**Exhibit helpfulness and gratitude regularly**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The researchers say that “studies show that people who engage in the habit of expressing gratitude are more likely to be helpful, generous, compassionate, and forgiving–and they’re also more likely to be happy and healthy.”  Which means that parents should be holding their kids accountable for chores and their expressions of gratitude throughout their days.  However, researchers have suggested that parents only give praise to “uncommon acts of kindness” when it comes to rewarding ‘positive’ behavior.</span>\n\n**Teach them how to see the bigger picture**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the researchers, “almost all children empathize with and care about a small circle of families and friends,” which means that the key to this tip is being able to get them to care about people who lie outside of these familiar circles.  To do this, teach them how to be excellent listeners, encourage them to try to place themselves in another’s position, and use opportune moments to teach them how to empathize.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final quote of the study says this:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Raising a caring, respectful, ethical child is and always has been hard work.

Their iconic status in Africa is well known, but **[new research](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aje.12220/epdf)** is showing that they might be in trouble.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All over the continent, giraffes are disappearing in great numbers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the year 1998, there has been a massive 43 percent decrease in population, leaving about 80,000 of the creatures to graze across 21 African nations, highlights the study.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s actually causing such a dramatic decline in their numbers can be attributed to a number of things, including habitat loss, human-wildlife conflicts, and poaching and slashing.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is worse in different regions of the continent, like in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where giraffes are close to being “locally” extinct with only 30 or 40 giraffes alive in the country, says Stephanie Fennessy, program director with the **[Giraffe Conservation Foundation](http://www.giraffeconservation.org/)**(GCF).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The perception is that giraffe numbers are huge. And that they are everywhere. And there’s no need to protect them,” Fennessy told The Dodo.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This perception is slowly starting to become realized as false, and now time is no longer on their side.  One sort of ‘silver lining’ to these animals being researched, however, is that scientists are continuing to learn more about the giraffe’s capacity for emotion, and are weeding out old myths in the process.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoe Muller, founder of the </span>**[Rothschild’s Giraffe Project](http://www.girafferesearch.com/)**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask any safari guide in Africa about their behavior and they will delight in telling you how female giraffe are bad mothers, apparently abandoning their young hours after giving birth and leaving them alone and vulnerable in the African bush.” </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notion that Muller has found to be untrue.  One giraffe that she followed during her research gave birth to a calf in the spring of 2010.  At around one month of age and suffering from a deformed leg, the calf struggled to walk and rarely moved because of it.  But the mother giraffe never left its side.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[S]he could always be found next to her calf, standing with it and being vigilant to the surrounding area,” Muller wrote.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the baby calf passed away one morning, most likely due to natural causes.  But, shortly after, Muller discovered 17 other female giraffes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“all highly vigilant and running around in apparently bizarre patterns.”</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bI20ZglxOI?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Muller is reluctant to categorize their behavior as “mourning,” she acknowledges that it is similar to another mammal that is notorious for their grieving of lost loved ones: elephants.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is well documented that elephants show great interest in the carcasses and bones of other dead elephants and herd members, often viewed as evidence of their empathic nature and ability to ‘mourn’ their dead,” she says.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“…</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we are only just beginning to understand the complexities of their social systems and family networks.

One sort of ‘silver lining’ to these animals being researched, however, is that scientists are continuing to learn more about the giraffe’s capacity for emotion, and are weeding out old myths in the process.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoe Muller, founder of the </span><strong><a href=\"http://www.girafferesearch.com/\">Rothschild’s Giraffe Project</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask any safari guide in Africa about their behavior and they will delight in telling you how female giraffe are bad mothers, apparently abandoning their young hours after giving birth and leaving them alone and vulnerable in the African bush.” </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notion that Muller has found to be untrue.  One giraffe that she followed during her research gave birth to a calf in the spring of 2010.  At around one month of age and suffering from a deformed leg, the calf struggled to walk and rarely moved because of it.  But the mother giraffe never left its side.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[S]he could always be found next to her calf, standing with it and being vigilant to the surrounding area,” Muller wrote.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the baby calf passed away one morning, most likely due to natural causes.  But, shortly after, Muller discovered 17 other female giraffes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“all highly vigilant and running around in apparently bizarre patterns.”</span></p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bI20ZglxOI?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Muller is reluctant to categorize their behavior as “mourning,” she acknowledges that it is similar to another mammal that is notorious for their grieving of lost loved ones: elephants.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is well documented that elephants show great interest in the carcasses and bones of other dead elephants and herd members, often viewed as evidence of their empathic nature and ability to ‘mourn’ their dead,” she says.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“…</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we are only just beginning to understand the complexities of their social systems and family networks. This incident provides us a unique insight into one aspect of giraffe behavior that we are rarely afforded a glance of — that of family ties and effects of the loss of a herd member.”</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can watch a video of the incident <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bI20ZglxOI\">here</a></strong>, and below is video of a mother giraffe who took on a pride of lions after they took her calf, showcasing the female giraffe’s willingness to endure danger for the sake of their young.</span></p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"878\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMU_F3arSA?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<p>h/t <a href=\"https://www.thedodo.com/giraffe-mothers-conservation-1170369798.html\"><strong>The Dodo</strong></a></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/feature_ima555555ge_656565template.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-07-10 07:50:26","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-07-10 07:50:26","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-07-10 07:50:26","published_by":1},{"id":192,"uuid":"438f88f8-48cb-4dca-a91a-4789b0792faa","title":"How To Check If the Pavement is Too Hot For Your Dog","slug":"how-to-check-if-the-pavement-is-too-hot-for-your-dog","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every good dog owner probably has the basics of pup safety down when it comes to surviving the summer heat.

Instead, focus on the ones who you like being with, the ones who love you for who you are and who encourage your growth.

Don’t get down on your luck; figure out what’s wrong and then work hard to fix it.  You create the reality you live in.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are six things you need to start doing for yourself right now:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Spend your time with the ones who matter</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life is too short to keep negative or toxic people in your world.  Instead, focus on the ones who you like being with, the ones who love you for who you are and who encourage your growth.  These are the people who not only love who you are, but support who you want to be.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Face life’s challenges and problems head on</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has problems in their life, but our reactions and behaviors concerning them are what truly define us.

Always be completely honest with yourself when it comes to what is wrong and what has to change.  At the end of the day, you are the only person you can count on.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognize where you are now and how you ended up here, then you can start to move toward where you want to go.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Recognize that your happiness is just as important as other’s</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us get so caught up in being the generous, caring individuals that we are, that we sometimes forget that we have our own needs and desires that need to be fulfilled.

While we sleep we disconnect our consciousness from the physical world and instead we connect more deeply with our higher self. This connection helps us create with greater ease.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There’s a reason why people tell you to “sleep on it” when you have a big decision-in our dream state we gain clarity and understanding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We are awesome creators from our sleeping state!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In addition to helping us solve our problems and deliberately create, sleep makes us feel good, boosts our immunity, and helps us heal from injury and illness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So, whenever it’s possible, it’s a good idea to take advantage of sleep.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here are 20 things you can do at bedtime to raise your vibration and become a better deliberate creator.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Enjoy!</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Bedtime DOs:</span>\n\n1. <span class=\"s1\">Do give big hugs to the people you love before bedtime, if you live with them 🙂</span>\n2. <span class=\"s1\">After a rough day, do take a shower or bath before bedtime to wash off the stress and elevate your vibration before drifting off.</span>\n3. <span class=\"s1\">Do get some water to put on your nightstand. Sometimes at night we get thirsty, and we always feel better when we’re hydrated.</span>\n4. <span class=\"s1\">Do take a moment to snuggle into bed, and appreciate how comfortable your bedding and pajamas are.</span>\n5. <span class=\"s1\">Do spend a few moments appreciating what went well during the day.</span>\n6. <span class=\"s1\">Do ask a question of the universe before bed. We get lots of clarity from the dream state. You could ask something like “what should I do about that problem at work?” or “what kind of present would my best friend love for her birthday?”</span>\n7. <span class=\"s1\">Do set your intention to enjoy the next day.</span>\n8. <span class=\"s1\">Do create a peaceful atmosphere in your bedroom. Peaceful places inspire peaceful feelings.</span>\n9. <span class=\"s1\">If you like to watch television before bedtime, do be mindful of the programming you select. When we sleep, we often dwell on our last thoughts of the day, so be sure to select programming that’s light and* makes you feel good.*</span>\n10. <span class=\"s1\">Do close the blinds or invest in heavy curtains if you want to sleep in the next day.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The light of day is hard to ignore when it’s shining on your face!</span>\n11. <span class=\"s1\">If you’ve got a few dollars to go shopping, do invest quality bedding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s easier to enjoy your sleep when you are comfortable! Being well-rested will help you manifest greater abundance, so comfy bedding *is worth every penny*.</span>\n12. <span class=\"s1\">Do select a soothing alarm for the morning. Awaken to pleasing music or ringtones to gently transition into the daytime.</span>\n13. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to forgive and forget before going to bed. A fight that isn’t resolved at night will just pick right back up in the morning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Why tarnish your tomorrow over something that happened today?</span>\n14. <span class=\"s1\">Do invest in an eye mask and earplugs if you are a light sleeper or if your partner snores.</span>\n15. <span class=\"s1\">Do try out a sleep mediation or sleep hypnosis, especially if you could use a boost!</span>\n16. <span class=\"s1\">Do avoid social media before bedtime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>There are a lot of things running through your newsfeed, some of which may have the potential to rattle your cage while you are wanting to relax.</span>\n17. <span class=\"s1\">Do take it easy if you find yourself wide awake.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Instead of* trying* to fall asleep, go along with the wakefulness without struggling.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can tell yourself “I’m just going to relax and take this opportunity to fantasize about pleasant things” and “when my body needs sleep it will shut me down.” The less you struggle, the easier it is to unwind. After all, if you’re going to be awake, you might as well be awake and happy!</span>\n18. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to review your “to do list” in the morning instead of at night. You can’t get tomorrow’s work done today.</span>\n19. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to go to sleep at a reasonable time (whatever that means for you of course!). Sometimes there are reasons we have to stay up extra late, but when you have the opportunity to enjoy a good night’s rest, take advantage of it!</span>\n20. <span class=\"s1\">If you’re a lucid dreamer, do set your intention to have a lucid dream. Lucid dreaming is AWESOME, and it can put you on cloud nine!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If you’d like to learn how to lucid dream, I highly recommend *Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming*, by Stephen LaBerge.</span>\n\n*<span class=\"s1\">**Related Article:**[**A 3-Part Morning Routine for Law of Attraction Junkies** ](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/08/03/morning-routine-for-law-of-attraction/ \"LOA Article\")</span>*\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I hope you like these bedtime tips for raising your vibration and becoming a more deliberate creator!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you have any other nighttime suggestions, feel free to comment below and share them with me. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span>\n\n### Are you learning how to raise your vibration?\n\nSign up for my free **[Law of Attraction newsletter](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&id=db39a47128 \"subscribe\")** for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.

This connection helps us create with greater ease.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">There’s a reason why people tell you to “sleep on it” when you have a big decision-in our dream state we gain clarity and understanding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We are awesome creators from our sleeping state!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">In addition to helping us solve our problems and deliberately create, sleep makes us feel good, boosts our immunity, and helps us heal from injury and illness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So, whenever it’s possible, it’s a good idea to take advantage of sleep.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Here are 20 things you can do at bedtime to raise your vibration and become a better deliberate creator.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Enjoy!</span></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"spanclasss1bedtimedosspan\"><span class=\"s1\">Bedtime DOs:</span></h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do give big hugs to the people you love before bedtime, if you live with them 🙂</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">After a rough day, do take a shower or bath before bedtime to wash off the stress and elevate your vibration before drifting off.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do get some water to put on your nightstand. Sometimes at night we get thirsty, and we always feel better when we’re hydrated.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do take a moment to snuggle into bed, and appreciate how comfortable your bedding and pajamas are.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do spend a few moments appreciating what went well during the day.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do ask a question of the universe before bed. We get lots of clarity from the dream state. You could ask something like “what should I do about that problem at work?” or “what kind of present would my best friend love for her birthday?”</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do set your intention to enjoy the next day.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do create a peaceful atmosphere in your bedroom. Peaceful places inspire peaceful feelings.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">If you like to watch television before bedtime, do be mindful of the programming you select. When we sleep, we often dwell on our last thoughts of the day, so be sure to select programming that’s light and* makes you feel good.*</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do close the blinds or invest in heavy curtains if you want to sleep in the next day.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The light of day is hard to ignore when it’s shining on your face!</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">If you’ve got a few dollars to go shopping, do invest quality bedding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s easier to enjoy your sleep when you are comfortable! Being well-rested will help you manifest greater abundance, so comfy bedding <em>is worth every penny</em>.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do select a soothing alarm for the morning. Awaken to pleasing music or ringtones to gently transition into the daytime.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do choose to forgive and forget before going to bed. A fight that isn’t resolved at night will just pick right back up in the morning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Why tarnish your tomorrow over something that happened today?</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do invest in an eye mask and earplugs if you are a light sleeper or if your partner snores.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do try out a sleep mediation or sleep hypnosis, especially if you could use a boost!</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do avoid social media before bedtime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>There are a lot of things running through your newsfeed, some of which may have the potential to rattle your cage while you are wanting to relax.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do take it easy if you find yourself wide awake.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Instead of* trying* to fall asleep, go along with the wakefulness without struggling.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can tell yourself “I’m just going to relax and take this opportunity to fantasize about pleasant things” and “when my body needs sleep it will shut me down.” The less you struggle, the easier it is to unwind. After all, if you’re going to be awake, you might as well be awake and happy!</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do choose to review your “to do list” in the morning instead of at night. You can’t get tomorrow’s work done today.</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Do choose to go to sleep at a reasonable time (whatever that means for you of course!). Sometimes there are reasons we have to stay up extra late, but when you have the opportunity to enjoy a good night’s rest, take advantage of it!</span>  </li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">If you’re a lucid dreamer, do set your intention to have a lucid dream. Lucid dreaming is AWESOME, and it can put you on cloud nine!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If you’d like to learn how to lucid dream, I highly recommend <em>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</em>, by Stephen LaBerge.</span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Related Article:</strong><a href=\"http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2015/08/03/morning-routine-for-law-of-attraction/\" title=\"LOA Article\"><strong>A 3-Part Morning Routine for Law of Attraction Junkies</strong> </a></span></em></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">I hope you like these bedtime tips for raising your vibration and becoming a more deliberate creator!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">If you have any other nighttime suggestions, feel free to comment below and share them with me. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">XO, Andrea</span></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"areyoulearninghowtoraiseyourvibration\">Are you learning how to raise your vibration?</h3>\n\n<p>Sign up for my free <strong><a href=\"http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=36d05de151fc23b6dee2dd220&amp;id=db39a47128\" title=\"subscribe\">Law of Attraction newsletter</a></strong> for conscious advice to help you attract positive outcomes into your life.

If you invite us out for drinks with 30 other people, chances are we’ll say no.  Or you cannot invite us at all, we’re fine with either, we just want to go home.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>We’re not super interested in what you did this weekend</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As introverts, we carefully pick and choose the people we spend our time with.  Random acquaintances and coworkers don’t often fit the bill.  We won’t judge you for how you spend your time and think that everyone needs a bit of privacy, but we can’t spend energy on you either.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Crowds are not for us</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being around a large number of people can be incredibly overwhelming, simply because there are so many different people, all unique in their own way.  And if an introvert is also somewhat empathic, they’re prone to absorbing the energies of others.  This makes crowded spaces too stimulating and chaotic for us.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>We can be extroverted when we want to</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being social is not </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">entirely</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> alien to us.  We can be the charismatic and lively partygoer, and we can host social events.  But know that often times the thing getting us through these events is knowing that we’ll be able to go home afterward.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After experiences like these, we like to take a few days or weeks to recharge.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rude, shy and uptight do not describe us</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people get angry with introverts or feel that they cannot talk to them.  It might seem this way initially, but once you get to know us, you’ll find that we make good friends who are never lacking in good conversation or bouts of laughter.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re terrible at faking emotions, so our faces usually betray any attempt to stifle them.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>We’re very picky about who we spend time with</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alone time is precious to us, so choosing to spend time with other people is a big deal.  If we choose the wrong person, we can be easily drained and overwhelmed.  Other introverts are a good choice because of their groundedness and sense of control, while extroverts tend to wane on us.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being around other introverts is easy because of the mutual understandings.</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/feature_i5554645mage_template.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-07-18 07:36:07","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-07-18 07:36:07","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-07-18 07:36:07","published_by":1},{"id":205,"uuid":"be94aad4-6369-43b4-88da-9d1ec2ca5741","title":"What One Woman Did After Seeing a Sad Man and His Family in the Freezing Cold Will Shock You","slug":"what-one-woman-did-after-seeing-a-sad-man-and-his-family-in-the-freezing-cold-will-shock-you","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Valley, Minnesota is the where this story takes place, and if you know anything about Minnesota, you know that it’s notorious for its freezing temperatures.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman named Nicole was on her to way to work one day when she stopped at a gas station in Apple Valley to fill up.

Some of us have short fuses that ignite some of the biggest bombs ever seen; others let their angry thoughts bounce around inside of them, reluctant to express them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Zodiac sign has a lot to do with how you handle your anger. And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel. Ranting, raving, kicking, screaming.. The leo is very capable of making a grand spectacle. And, they’re quick to say things that really hurt, so if they do, just know that it’s one of the only ways they know how to release their anger: venting. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not likely to hold a grudge, however, and will probably move past most conflicts fairly fast.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for being both patient and loving, the Virgo has a great capacity for abuse before being set off in an angry way. Because they like to avoid confrontation, Virgos will often become incredibly passive aggressive. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not going to hold a grudge, but they’re not going to forget about what you did, either.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a peacekeeper, the Libra’s scales fit perfectly here. Balance is valued in everything, especially relationships. This means that confrontation is often avoided, and emotions get bottled up. Even when they’re at the peak of their frustration, Libras do their best to wear a happy face as they hold back their rage. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the hurt is great enough, they are definitely capable of holding a grudge.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other signs, the Scorpio doesn’t let out anger as it comes to them. You can always tell if a Scorpio is angry by looking into their eyes. Their eyes will say more than anything. They’re usually venting in their minds, planning their next move. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they suddenly get really quiet and you see angry eyes come out, give them some space. And don’t try to force them into anything before they’re ready.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surefire ways to piss off a Sagittarius include dishonesty, disloyalty, being cruel and spewing hate speech. While they tend to be a patient sign, and they don’t angry very often, when they do get angry they’re not interested in playing nice, </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at all</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know they’re starting to get angry when the heavy sarcasm starts pouring out.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Earth sign, Capricorns aren’t too pent up with anger. They like to keep things easy-going, but also have a threshold you can reach. You’re most likely to piss them off by accidentally messing up the ‘zen’ of their space. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns get angry for seemingly random reasons, and they don’t like to express it. They enjoy sulking before they’re ready to throw a tantrum.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguing is the last thing the Aquarius wants to do, so that’s what they tend to avoid, choosing to completely ignore people instead. If they can’t seem to get away from whatever it is that’s upsetting them, they’re likely to blow up just because of how frustrated they are. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on who they’re arguing with, they may or may not want to continue the relationship.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pisces is somewhat volatile, meaning you never know what’s going to light their fuse. If they’re having a bad day already, it’s easier for them to explode. But, they don’t enjoy confrontation and would rather avoid it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a smoke or a drink won’t help, they know that crying will. Of all the signs, Pisceans tend to cry the most when it comes to anger and frustration.</span>\n\nh/t [**SpiritScience**](http://thespiritscience.net/2016/07/13/how-each-sign-of-the-zodiac-expresses-their-anger/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anger is one of those emotions that comes out in everyone differently.

We identify all the things we DON’T have, and we go to work to try to make them happen. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, we focus on the boyfriend we don’t have yet, the promotion we haven’t gotten, or the weight we haven’t lost yet.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We focus on what is lacking in order to try to create what is wanted into our realities.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this strategy doesn’t work! You’ve gotta make peace with what is first.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">When life isn’t good enough as it is</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you focused on why your life isn’t good enough as it is, you only amplify the “my life isn’t good enough” vibe. Then, thanks to the Law of Attraction, your life will continue to feel “not good enough!” Your reality will always reflect back to you your dominant belief structure.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, you can’t focus on how much your hate your current home and hope you’ll be able to find one you’ll love. Sure, you may move and you may find a new home.  However, rest assured, you will be just as dissatisfied with your new home as you were with the old one. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is because with the LOA we are always creating whatever is a match to our dominant thought patterns.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If we believe where we live sucks, then where we live must continue to suck. It doesn’t matter where we go or how many times we move.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You’d be much more successful in making peace with your current home, and coming to love it as it is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Once you make peace with your current home, you become a match to homes you love. </span><span class=\"s1\">The universe will knock its socks off to match whatever you’re putting out there.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you want your life to be great, you have to start projecting the vibe that says “my life is great now!” This is done by making peace with what is, and loving it as it stands.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Why so many people project dissatisfaction over satisfaction</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I know making peace with what is can seem a bit counterintuitive. </span>\n\nMost people have been raised to believe they have to improve their lives, and that their lives aren’t good enough as they are. People are also often taught to evaluate the problems in their lives more closely than the blessings.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this social programming keeps many of us stuck in a rut. This is why you know a guy who’s on his third failed marriage. This is why you have a friend who is always sick. This is why so many people go on a different diet every year.  \n</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When we focus on what’s lacking, we create more lack. On the surface things may change, but it’s just the same shit, different day.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remind yourself of this principle of the LOA on a regular basis. When you find yourself criticizing where you are, remember you are perpetuating lack. Being happy where you stand will make you a match to people, events and situations that reinforce your happiness, not your lack.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">How do you make peace with what is?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">One thing you can do right now to make peace with where you are is to play the “perspective game.” The perspective game enables you to make peace with where you are in the present moment.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To play this game, step into someone else’s shoes and evaluate your life from an alternative perspective.  List out the things you have, and view them from the perspective of* not* having them. Imagine living a life where the things you have right now are still just dreams to you. The bigger the list, the better.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here is a short list of things I have in my life.  To play the perspective game, I write out the list, and then take a moment imagining my life without these blessings: </span>\n\n1. <span class=\"s1\">I have two healthy and adorable children.</span>\n2. <span class=\"s1\">I have a wonderful husband who loves me and treats me like a queen.</span>\n3. <span class=\"s1\">I have a great relationship with my brother. He is a kindred spirit to me.</span>\n4. <span class=\"s1\">I have close friends I get to spend lots of time with.</span>\n5. <span class=\"s1\">I have a bunch of friendly and positive clients and I run my own business.</span>\n6. <span class=\"s1\">I’m healthy and in good shape.</span>\n7. <span class=\"s1\">I’ve had an exceptional education, and I have lots of skills and knowledge that benefit me because of it.</span>\n8. <span class=\"s1\">I live near the beach.</span>\n9. <span class=\"s1\">I drive my own car.</span>\n10. <span class=\"s1\">I get to vacation several times every year.</span>\n11. <span class=\"s1\">I own my own home.</span>\n12. <span class=\"s1\">I have money in the bank and my expenses are always paid with ease.</span>\n13. <span class=\"s1\">I really like all of my neighbors.</span>\n14. <span class=\"s1\">I’ve got an awesome phone and computer and all kinds of cool technological gadgets.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To me, each of the items on this list seems very normal to me, because they are each a part of my current reality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, these things are HUGE dreams for some people out there. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In fact, just looking at this list makes me feel like my life is pretty great.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  I can’t even imagine living a life without my relationships, my health or my education. Yet,* *there are people out there who live without these blessings every day.</span></span>\n\nIt’s very hard for me to justify dissatisfaction with my life when I look at things from this perspective.  I’m just too grateful for what I have when I look at it this way.\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Why perspective matters</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When I look at this list through the perspective of those who don’t have what I already have, it reminds me just how blessed I truly am. When I look at my life through this lens, it’s easy for me to make peace with where I am. </span>\n\n***Related Article:**[20 Heartfelt Ways to Say Thank You](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/06/heartfelt-ways-to-say-thank-you/ \"LOA Article\")*\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When I look through my life focused on what I *haven’t *created or achieved, it’s much, much easier to feel unfulfilled. I’m not at peace when I evaluate my life based on my unfulfilled dreams.  How at peace I am with my life has everything to do with which perspective I choose to take.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In playing this perspective game, you come to see all of the wonderful things you have already created in your life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You are focused on what you HAVE rather than what you DON’T have.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This projects a vibe that shouts out “I am fortunate in so many ways!”</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A message like this becomes reinforced in your reality, allowing more and more good things to come into your life. The universe must continue to bless you, if you believe you are blessed.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Work within the paradox!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you are wanting to use the Law of Attraction to improve your quality of life, make sure you are working within the paradox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You’ve gotta make peace with what is before something better will come along. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remember, your life is great *right here and now, regardless of where you stand.  *There are always dreams you have achieved, and there are always reasons to be grateful.* *When you acknowledge this truth and declare your life to be great, your life will reflect greatness back to you in spades.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">How is your life already great? Why is where you stand a wonderful place to be?
