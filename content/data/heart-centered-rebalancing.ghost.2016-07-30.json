Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1.

Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks.

This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Facebook (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.

We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.\n\nOur cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services.\n\nMost browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.\n\nInformation Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons\n\nTo support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.\n\nAdvertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.\n\nTo increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\n\nAggregate Information\n\nWe collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.\n\nHow, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?\n\nThe Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.\n\nPublic Information about Your Activity on the Services\n\nSome of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.\n\nPlease also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.\n\nIP Address Information\n\nWhile we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.\n\nInformation You Elect to Share\n\nYou may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services’ privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.\n\nAggregate Information\n\nWe share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.\n\nInformation Shared with Our Agents\n\nWe employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.\n\nInformation Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers\n\nIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\n\nInformation Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others\n\nWe also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.\n\nInformation We Share With Your Consent\n\nExcept as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.\n\nIs Information About Me Secure?\n\nWe store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?\n\nYou can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.\n\nYou can always opt not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take advantage of some of our features.\n\nWhat Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?\n\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Services after such changes have been first posted.\n\nWhat If I Have Questions or Concerns?\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message through our Contact Us page.\n\nEffective Date: 06-09-2013\n\n ","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Overview</p>\n\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Heart Centered Rebalancing.

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, NOR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) $500.00.\n\nARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER—IMPORTANT—PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.\n\n1.Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this User Agreement.\n2.Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n\nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction. This User Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this User Agreement shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.\n\nModification.

The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder\n\nForce Majeure.

This User Agreement is personal to you, and is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.\n\nAgency.

Unless otherwise specified in this User Agreement, all notices under this User Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.\n\nNo Waiver. Our failure to enforce any part of this User Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of this User Agreement. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with this User Agreement to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.\n\nHeadings.

sinuses.</span></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth and apply pressure (not too much).</span>  </li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Press your thumb between your eyebrows</span>  </li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Press your thumb down for 30 seconds while applying a fair amount of pressure</span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pretty sweet, right?  Remember this method the next time you or your friend’s sinuses are chock-full of phlegm and you find yourself hating life!</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/feature_image_tearemplate.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":6,"created_at":"2016-05-09T06:29:37.000Z","created_by":5,"updated_at":"2016-05-09T06:29:37.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-05-09T06:29:37.000Z","published_by":5},{"id":394,"uuid":"43009853-41ac-4667-a97b-35cb1e0c2523","title":"This

Zodiac Sign Says A Lot About How You Express Anger","slug":"your-zodiac-sign-says-a-lot-about-how-you-express-anger","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anger is one of those emotions that comes out in everyone differently. Some of us have short fuses that ignite some of the biggest bombs ever seen; others let their angry thoughts bounce around inside of them, reluctant to express them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Zodiac sign has a lot to do with how you handle your anger. And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel. Ranting, raving, kicking, screaming.. The leo is very capable of making a grand spectacle. And, they’re quick to say things that really hurt, so if they do, just know that it’s one of the only ways they know how to release their anger: venting. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not likely to hold a grudge, however, and will probably move past most conflicts fairly fast.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for being both patient and loving, the Virgo has a great capacity for abuse before being set off in an angry way. Because they like to avoid confrontation, Virgos will often become incredibly passive aggressive. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not going to hold a grudge, but they’re not going to forget about what you did, either.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a peacekeeper, the Libra’s scales fit perfectly here. Balance is valued in everything, especially relationships. This means that confrontation is often avoided, and emotions get bottled up. Even when they’re at the peak of their frustration, Libras do their best to wear a happy face as they hold back their rage. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the hurt is great enough, they are definitely capable of holding a grudge.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other signs, the Scorpio doesn’t let out anger as it comes to them. You can always tell if a Scorpio is angry by looking into their eyes. Their eyes will say more than anything. They’re usually venting in their minds, planning their next move. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they suddenly get really quiet and you see angry eyes come out, give them some space. And don’t try to force them into anything before they’re ready.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surefire ways to piss off a Sagittarius include dishonesty, disloyalty, being cruel and spewing hate speech. While they tend to be a patient sign, and they don’t angry very often, when they do get angry they’re not interested in playing nice, </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at all</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know they’re starting to get angry when the heavy sarcasm starts pouring out.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Earth sign, Capricorns aren’t too pent up with anger. They like to keep things easy-going, but also have a threshold you can reach. You’re most likely to piss them off by accidentally messing up the ‘zen’ of their space. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns get angry for seemingly random reasons, and they don’t like to express it. They enjoy sulking before they’re ready to throw a tantrum.</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguing is the last thing the Aquarius wants to do, so that’s what they tend to avoid, choosing to completely ignore people instead. If they can’t seem to get away from whatever it is that’s upsetting them, they’re likely to blow up just because of how frustrated they are. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on who they’re arguing with, they may or may not want to continue the relationship.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pisces is somewhat volatile, meaning you never know what’s going to light their fuse. If they’re having a bad day already, it’s easier for them to explode. But, they don’t enjoy confrontation and would rather avoid it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a smoke or a drink won’t help, they know that crying will. Of all the signs, Pisceans tend to cry the most when it comes to anger and frustration.</span>\n\nh/t [**SpiritScience**](http://thespiritscience.net/2016/07/13/how-each-sign-of-the-zodiac-expresses-their-anger/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anger is one of those emotions that comes out in everyone differently.

And knowing how to handle your anger is the first step in building healthier, more positive thought patterns.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how each Zodiac sign expresses anger:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a fire sign, Aries are known for blowing up and fast. They’re not known for starting arguments or conflict, but they’re incredibly good at ending them. If they aren’t ready to do something, or get forced into something, you will likely see the fire within them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, just as they’re quick to ignite, they’re quick to forgive and forget.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a lot to anger the Taurus, but, should you succeed, good luck trying to make it out alive. They don’t like to waste their energy on angry thoughts, but if you betray them, are disloyal or treat them as inferior, they’re ready to rumble. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them the time and space they need to calm down as they can stay angry for long periods of time.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s anyone’s guess as to how the Twins will express their anger. They like to cut deep wounds with a calm, centered demeanor, and they absolutely love to talk. So, if you piss them off, you will undoubtedly get an earful. Just don’t tell them what to do and they’ll likely forgive you.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underneath the Cancer’s hard and protective shell lies a loyal, understanding and sweet being whose only wish is for people to return their affection. This is what usually upsets the Cancer; feeling unloved or unappreciated. You can always tell when a Cancer is angry because they’ll usually sulk around passive-aggressively. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t ignore their pleas, it will only hurt them more.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Leo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An angry Leo has no trouble telling you exactly how they feel. Ranting, raving, kicking, screaming.. The leo is very capable of making a grand spectacle. And, they’re quick to say things that really hurt, so if they do, just know that it’s one of the only ways they know how to release their anger: venting. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not likely to hold a grudge, however, and will probably move past most conflicts fairly fast.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Virgo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known for being both patient and loving, the Virgo has a great capacity for abuse before being set off in an angry way. Because they like to avoid confrontation, Virgos will often become incredibly passive aggressive. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They’re not going to hold a grudge, but they’re not going to forget about what you did, either.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Libra</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a peacekeeper, the Libra’s scales fit perfectly here. Balance is valued in everything, especially relationships. This means that confrontation is often avoided, and emotions get bottled up. Even when they’re at the peak of their frustration, Libras do their best to wear a happy face as they hold back their rage. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the hurt is great enough, they are definitely capable of holding a grudge.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Scorpio</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to other signs, the Scorpio doesn’t let out anger as it comes to them. You can always tell if a Scorpio is angry by looking into their eyes. Their eyes will say more than anything. They’re usually venting in their minds, planning their next move. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they suddenly get really quiet and you see angry eyes come out, give them some space. And don’t try to force them into anything before they’re ready.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surefire ways to piss off a Sagittarius include dishonesty, disloyalty, being cruel and spewing hate speech. While they tend to be a patient sign, and they don’t angry very often, when they do get angry they’re not interested in playing nice, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at all</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll know they’re starting to get angry when the heavy sarcasm starts pouring out.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Capricorn</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an Earth sign, Capricorns aren’t too pent up with anger. They like to keep things easy-going, but also have a threshold you can reach. You’re most likely to piss them off by accidentally messing up the ‘zen’ of their space. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns get angry for seemingly random reasons, and they don’t like to express it. They enjoy sulking before they’re ready to throw a tantrum.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aquarius</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguing is the last thing the Aquarius wants to do, so that’s what they tend to avoid, choosing to completely ignore people instead. If they can’t seem to get away from whatever it is that’s upsetting them, they’re likely to blow up just because of how frustrated they are. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on who they’re arguing with, they may or may not want to continue the relationship.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pisces</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pisces is somewhat volatile, meaning you never know what’s going to light their fuse. If they’re having a bad day already, it’s easier for them to explode. But, they don’t enjoy confrontation and would rather avoid it. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a smoke or a drink won’t help, they know that crying will. Of all the signs, Pisceans tend to cry the most when it comes to anger and frustration.</span></p>\n\n<p>h/t <a href=\"http://thespiritscience.net/2016/07/13/how-each-sign-of-the-zodiac-expresses-their-anger/\"><strong>SpiritScience</strong></a></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/feature_image_sfdgsdftemplate.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":6,"created_at":"2016-07-23T06:05:16.000Z","created_by":5,"updated_at":"2016-07-26T22:36:30.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-07-23T06:05:16.000Z","published_by":5},{"id":398,"uuid":"733f4311-7723-4e1a-9364-cfda56c31863","title":"Terms of Service","slug":"terms-of-service","markdown":"#Terms of Service\n\nWeb Site Terms and Conditions of Use\n\n  1.

With Heartbreak Using Your Zodiac Sign","slug":"dealing-with-heartbreak-using-your-zodiac-sign","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re going through a tough time and have had to separate from your partner recently, you might be left feeling lost and confused.  Heartbreak affects everyone differently, and your zodiac sign has a lot to do with that.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a bit of insight as to how each sign handles the pain of heartbreak, so that you might grow a little easier:</span>\n\n**Aquarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting close to people is difficult for you, so when you do fall, you fall hard; which makes breaking up that much harder.  You’re not one to outwardly express the pain you’re feeling because you don’t like feeling vulnerable, so you stay busy and speak only to those who are close to you.</span>\n\n**Pisces**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re likely to fully embrace the sadness and sorrow accompanied with most breakups, but you do so because you are not worried about being vulnerable or showing ‘weakness.’  You know that to fully heal you must finish your grieving.</span>\n\n**Aries**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Aries gets hurt, they tend to look to their friends for support because of how social and outgoing they are.  Aries like to stay busy when they’re hurting; this lets them cover their pain with work and activities, pretending as if it hasn’t phased them.</span>\n\n**Taurus**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus struggles at times to adequately express how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking.  You’re quick to be set off as you occasionally let your emotions flare up, but you have only kindness in your heart, and want someone who loves as deeply as you do.</span>\n\n**Gemini**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gemini tend to live in the moment, so a failed relationship or parting of ways is simply water under the bridge.  They like to focus on what’s happening </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead of what happened yesterday.</span>\n\n**Cancer**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancers fall back on their career or work during times of emotional duress because they are natural leaders and enjoy working.  You like to hide your sensitive side, not letting your personal life and work life intersect.  And your friends are always the focus after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Leo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos are traditionally both loyal and faithful people, enjoying passionate relationships with their partners.  Because of this, they are often shocked when their partner wishes to separate.  Leos will undoubtedly be hurt, but are also very understanding, wishing their partners the best as they move in a different direction.</span>\n\n**Virgo**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos struggle to commit to one person, meaning they take breakups pretty hard.  But that doesn’t mean they’ll stay down for long.  They’re usually the first ones to be back in the dating scene, doing their best to move on–which they will.</span>\n\n**Libra**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The usually optimistic and upbeat Libra doesn’t stay hurt for long.  You might even be willing to stay friends with your former partner.  You will most likely spend most of your time with friends and family after a heartbreak.</span>\n\n**Scorpio**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scorpios are quick to become reclusive, wanting to deal with their emotions by themselves.  They don’t like others seeing how hurt they are, so they simply pretend that they’re not.  You’ll likely try to stay busy to avoid thinking about it.  Scorpios are very difficult to love, but they are also the most sensitive.</span>\n\n**Sagittarius**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius, being the carefree and lighthearted creatures that they are, tend to shrug off most breakups or separations.  That’s because the easiest way to deal with anything is to laugh, even when things are tough or sad.  But it’s a trait that the next person will absolutely love.</span>\n\n**Capricorn**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns take time to let people into their lives, but it’s always worth it because they are the best people to love.  Anyone who has broken up with you will come to regret it.  The Capricorn simply needs to give him or herself time to heal after a nasty breakup, even if it might take a lot of it.</span>\n\nh/t [**Puckermob**](http://www.puckermob.com/relationships/the-ways-you-deal-with-heartbreak-based-on-your-zodiac-sign)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span

you are not worried about being vulnerable or showing ‘weakness.’  You know that to fully heal you must finish your grieving.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aries</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Aries gets hurt, they tend to look to their friends for support because of how social and outgoing they are.  Aries like to stay busy when they’re hurting; this lets them cover their pain with work and activities, pretending as if it hasn’t phased them.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taurus</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Taurus struggles at times to adequately express how they’re feeling and what they’re thinking.  You’re quick to be set off as you occasionally let your emotions flare up, but you have only kindness in your heart, and want someone who loves as deeply as you do.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gemini tend to live in the moment, so a failed relationship or parting of ways is simply water under the bridge.  They like to focus on what’s happening </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">now</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, instead of what happened yesterday.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancers fall back on their career or work during times of emotional duress because they are natural leaders and enjoy working.  You like to hide your sensitive side, not letting your personal life and work life intersect.  And your friends are always the focus after a heartbreak.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Leo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leos are traditionally both loyal and faithful people, enjoying passionate relationships with their partners.  Because of this, they are often shocked when their partner wishes to separate.  Leos will undoubtedly be hurt, but are also very understanding, wishing their partners the best as they move in a different direction.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Virgo</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virgos struggle to commit to one person, meaning they take breakups pretty hard.  But that doesn’t mean they’ll stay down for long.  They’re usually the first ones to be back in the dating scene, doing their best to move on–which they will.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Libra</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The usually optimistic and upbeat Libra doesn’t stay hurt for long.  You might even be willing to stay friends with your former partner.  You will most likely spend most of your time with friends and family after a heartbreak.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Scorpio</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scorpios are quick to become reclusive, wanting to deal with their emotions by themselves.  They don’t like others seeing how hurt they are, so they simply pretend that they’re not.  You’ll likely try to stay busy to avoid thinking about it.  Scorpios are very difficult to love, but they are also the most sensitive.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sagittarius, being the carefree and lighthearted creatures that they are, tend to shrug off most breakups or separations.  That’s because the easiest way to deal with anything is to laugh, even when things are tough or sad.  But it’s a trait that the next person will absolutely love.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Capricorn</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capricorns take time to let people into their lives, but it’s always worth it because they are the best people to love.  Anyone who has broken up with you will come to regret it.  The Capricorn simply needs to give him or herself time to heal after a nasty breakup, even if it might take a lot of it.</span></p>\n\n<p>h/t <a

Ways the \"Old Soul\" Loves Differently","slug":"5-ways-the-old-soul-loves-differently","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, the ‘Old Soul.’  If you’re an old soul or have a friend who’s one, you know that we’re a little different from everyone else.  For whatever reason, we seem to handle ourselves better around older people and feel that our views on life are a little “before our time.”  This is why we enjoy spending time alone fairly often, because we’re misunderstood by our peers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that doesn’t mean we’re lonely people.  We’re just capable of enjoying the company we can provide ourselves.  We’re also pretty different when it comes to romance and relationships.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five things to know about how the old soul loves differently:</span>\n\n**They’re homebodies**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The homebody is the person who would rather stay in on Friday night instead of going out.  And they’re looking for a partner who shares this sentiment.  Bring over a bottle of wine, maybe some candles, and enjoy a relaxed night of conversation and good company.</span>\n\n**Not too concerned with material objects**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old souls are anything but materialistic, so don’t have high expectations for a giant diamond ring or brand new luxury car.  They enjoy expressing their affection through grand gestures that have deeper meaning, like love letters or poems.</span>\n\n**Old Souls communicate better than anyone else**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing games is something that the old soul simply doesn’t entertain when it comes to communication.  They’re going to tell you how they honestly feel, so don’t get caught too off guard by this; they have good intentions at heart.</span>\n\n**They only open up to select people**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old soul is almost incapable of having one night stands, simply because the only people they enjoy sleeping with are those who they’re emotionally invested in.  Sex without emotion, or a deeper connection, is meaningless, so don’t be surprised when they don’t open up immediately.</span>\n\n**Everything is done with purpose**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old soul is constantly thinking about the big picture. Meaning, if that picture doesn’t include you, they’re not going to keep you around.  “Settling” for a person is not something they’ll do; their partner is their partner because they want it that way and they see a future with that person.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rarely ever will an old soul do something without good reason.</span>\n\nh/t [**Rebel Circus **](http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/how-the-old-soul-loves-differently/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, the ‘Old Soul.’  If you’re an old soul or have a friend who’s one, you know that we’re a little different from everyone else.  For whatever reason, we seem to handle ourselves better around older people and feel that our views on life are a little “before our time.”  This is why we enjoy spending time alone fairly often, because we’re misunderstood by our peers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that doesn’t mean we’re lonely people.  We’re just capable of enjoying the company we can provide ourselves.  We’re also pretty different when it comes to romance and relationships.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five things to know about how the old soul loves differently:</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>They’re homebodies</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The homebody is the person who would rather stay in on Friday night instead of going out.  And they’re looking for a partner who shares this sentiment.  Bring over a bottle of wine, maybe some candles, and enjoy a relaxed night of conversation and good company.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Not too concerned with material objects</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old souls are anything but materialistic, so don’t have high expectations for a giant diamond ring or brand new luxury car.  They enjoy expressing their affection through grand gestures that have deeper meaning, like love letters or poems.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Old Souls communicate better than anyone else</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playing games is something that the old soul simply doesn’t entertain when it comes to communication.  They’re going to tell you how they honestly feel, so don’t get caught too off guard by this; they have good intentions at heart.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>They only open up to select people</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old soul is almost incapable of having one night stands, simply because the only people they enjoy sleeping with are those who they’re emotionally invested in.  Sex without emotion, or a deeper connection, is meaningless, so don’t be surprised when they don’t open up immediately.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Everything is done with purpose</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old soul is constantly thinking about the big picture.

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more than the average person.  And when I say feel, I mean it in every aspect of the word.  Empaths possess senses that are finely tuned and easily stimulated; heightened physical senses, like touch and hearing, are accompanied by heightened awareness of emotions and energies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this sounds like you, you could be an empath.  As one, you’re prone to absorbing the energies and feelings of those around you, which can be both good </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bad.  Good, because being around positive people allows you to soak up positive energy, and bad for the same reason.  If you have any toxic or negative people in your life, you’re likely to reflect their mood and energy, becoming toxic and negative yourself.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But don’t worry, because there are things you can do to manage your power.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, how can you tell for sure that you’re an empath?  There are numerous indicators, a few of which are listed below:</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sudden nausea after meeting someone unfamiliar or venturing into unfamiliar places</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Issues with the solar plexus, including a sensitive digestive tract, stomach pains, or a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You often reflect or mirror the energies and moods of those around you</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your emotions and senses confuse you</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Large crowds are overwhelming, making you withdraw from the setting</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You feel depressed at random times for seemingly no reason</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all traits that describe a person with a strong empathic affinity.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, a few methods and tips for managing your gift, so that you might not feel so exhausted and overwhelmed by the energies you face on a day-to-day basis:</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain crystals hold energy-deflecting properties.  Try wearing jet, black tourmaline, hematite, or tiger’s eye on the right side of your body.  These help push energy outward, helping you create a protective barrier around yourself.</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bathing in salts, like pink

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burn sage in and around yourself and the spaces you occupy</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practice saying “no” to people–Be honest and open when you tell them

crystal has specific traits and properties.  Some use them for healing, others for protection, and others for relaxation or meditation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, out of the hundreds of crystals you can choose to wear, there are about seven that cover all the key areas.  They’re inexpensive and easy to procure, meaning everyone should have them!</span>\n\n**Clear Quartz**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This wonderful crystal is a jack-of-all-trades.  It’s widely known for it’s ability to enhance, restore and regulate energies.  It can also help one channel their inner psychic abilities, boost the effectiveness of other crystals, enhance the immune system, as well as re-align our chakras.  </span>\n\n**Amethyst**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amethyst is used by many for it’s ability to help improve sleep, relaxation, meditation, and the opening of the crown chakra.  Additionally, it helps one to end bad habits and unhealthy addictions.  In this sense, it brings balance.  However, it also used as a psychic protection ward.</span>\n\n**Rose Quartz**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rose Quartz is your go-to crystal if you’ve been hurt or emotionally traumatized.  It’s inherently loving and gentle, helping its wearer to channel unconditional love for not only themselves, but for others.</span>\n\n**Selenite**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stone that builds a bridge between you and the angelic realm, it is known for purifying the mind, body and spirit.  Selenite is often used by those who struggle to make decisions, as it provides a mental clarity.  It’s also closely tied to the moon, putting you in touch with its energy.</span>\n\n**Black Tourmaline**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These stones are often placed in the corners of rooms where one wishes to remove (and prevent) any negativity or stress.  Empaths can gain a lot from this stone, as it protects the individual from the energies of emotionally toxic people.  </span>\n\n**Fluorite**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluorite is known for its ability to shield one’s aura from unwanted outside manipulation.  As powerful and enhancing psychic stone, it channels the upper chakras, absorbing disturbances around you.</span>\n\n**Citrine**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Predominantly an abundance crystal, this stone helps bring individuals financial stability.  Its ability to balance the solar plexus chakra helps promote an energized will power.  Others like to use it to boost creativity, and some like to use it to help find resolution during times of strife in their family or community.</span>\n\nh/t [**Mystical

after things in the world, so much so that people often act crazy or entirely unlike themselves when they’ve fallen for someone.  People of all ages want to find love, yet we see an astonishing number of relationships and marriages that fall apart over time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the five stages of love and why most people end up calling it quits after stage three:</span>\n\n**Stage 1 – Falling in love**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve never fallen in love before, give it a shot sometime.  It’s one of the craziest experiences that you’ll ever forget.  Falling in love is great for many reasons, but mostly because our brains get flooded with chemicals that are designed to make us feel amazing.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen are all swirling together to give us butterflies.  When you’re in love, no one call to you otherwise, because you’re 100% certain of the way you’re feeling.</span>\n\n**Stage 2 – Coming together as a couple**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During stage two, the love between two individuals becomes deeper and a little more mature.  This is the stage when most people want to have children and rear them together, as their bond becomes strengthened.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The individuals start making decisions based around the couple, rather than the individual.  Most people feel that this is the love that will last a lifetime, and they are often the same people that are so taken aback by stage three.</span>\n\n**Stage 3 – Becoming disillusioned**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage three often throws people for a loop because this is the time when one or both people start feeling uncertain about the direction that their relationship is headed.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stage three is when things start to feel wrong.  You become resentful and angry over the littlest things, you feel less loved and intimate, and you want out.  You want to bring back that spark or chemistry, but you’re unsure of how to do it.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting through stage three can be very difficult, but if the couple can survive it, they’ll come out on the other side stronger and more in love than ever.</span>\n\n**Stage 4 – Building a real, lasting love**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can make it through stage three, then stage four is your reward.  Stage four takes place after you’ve gotten to the core of all the pain and conflict and are now working to resolve it.  And part of resolving your issues is understanding that everyone is wounded on some level, and that these wounds play a large role in your relationships.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, ongoing research by The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study has shown that childhood trauma can affect our physical, emotional, and relational health in profound ways.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a lasting love means wanting to grow and help each other heal your wounds.  Once the two of you start to heal, you’ll notice the chemistry and feelings of true love start to flourish again.</span>\n\n**Stage 5 – Using your love to take on the world**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world is often seen as a pretty terrible place and for the most part, it is.  Thinking about the endless amount of conflict and turmoil that plagues every region of the planet can be disheartening; it makes us feel like there’s really nothing we can do individually to help out.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a lasting love between just two people is incredibly hard as it is, how can we do that with 7 billion people?  But maybe finding true love and then building a lasting love is the first step in this process.  If we can do this, then maybe we can start looking outward,

We identify all the things we DON’T have, and we go to work to try to make them happen. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, we focus on the boyfriend we don’t have yet, the promotion we haven’t gotten, or the weight we haven’t lost yet.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We focus on what is lacking in order to try to create what is wanted into our realities.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this strategy doesn’t work! You’ve gotta make peace with what is first.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">When life isn’t good enough as it is</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">If you focused on why your life isn’t good enough as it is, you only amplify the “my life isn’t good enough” vibe. Then, thanks to the Law of Attraction, your life will continue to feel “not good enough!” Your reality will always reflect back to you your dominant belief structure.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">For example, you can’t focus on how much your hate your current home and hope you’ll be able to find one you’ll love. Sure, you may move and you may find a new home.  However, rest assured, you will be just as dissatisfied with your new home as you were with the old one. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">This is because with the LOA we are always creating whatever is a match to our dominant thought patterns.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If we believe where we live sucks, then where we live must continue to suck. It doesn’t matter where we go or how many times we move.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">You’d be much more successful in making peace with your current home, and coming to love it as it is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Once you make peace with your current home, you become a match to homes you love. </span><span class=\"s1\">The universe will knock its socks off to match whatever you’re putting out there.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you want your life to be great, you have to start projecting the vibe that says “my life is great now!” This is done by making peace with what is, and loving it as it stands.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Why so many people project dissatisfaction over satisfaction</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">I know making peace with what is can seem a bit counterintuitive. </span>\n\nMost people have been raised to believe they have to improve their lives, and that their lives aren’t good enough as they are. People are also often taught to evaluate the problems in their lives more closely than the blessings.\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Unfortunately, this social programming keeps many of us stuck in a rut. This is why you know a guy who’s on his third failed marriage. This is why you have a friend who is always sick. This is why so many people go on a different diet every year.  \n</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When we focus on what’s lacking, we create more lack. On the surface things may change, but it’s just the same shit, different day.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remind yourself of this principle of the LOA on a regular basis. When you find yourself criticizing where you are, remember you are perpetuating lack. Being happy where you stand will make you a match to people, events and situations that reinforce your happiness, not your lack.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">How do you make peace with what is?</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">One thing you can do right now to make peace with where you are is to play the “perspective game.” The perspective game enables you to make peace with where you are in the present moment.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To play this game, step into someone else’s shoes and evaluate your life from an alternative perspective.  List out the things you have, and view them from the perspective of* not* having them. Imagine living a life where the things you have right now are still just dreams to you. The bigger the list, the better.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here is a short list of things I have in my life.  To play the perspective game, I write out the list, and then take a moment imagining my life without these blessings: </span>\n\n1. <span class=\"s1\">I have two healthy and adorable children.</span>\n2. <span class=\"s1\">I have a wonderful husband who loves me and treats me like a queen.</span>\n3. <span class=\"s1\">I have a great relationship with my brother. He is a kindred spirit to me.</span>\n4. <span class=\"s1\">I have close friends I get to spend lots of time with.</span>\n5. <span class=\"s1\">I have a bunch of friendly and positive clients and I run my own business.</span>\n6. <span class=\"s1\">I’m healthy and in good shape.</span>\n7. <span class=\"s1\">I’ve had an exceptional education, and I have lots of skills and knowledge that benefit me because of it.</span>\n8. <span class=\"s1\">I live near the beach.</span>\n9. <span class=\"s1\">I drive my own car.</span>\n10. <span class=\"s1\">I get to vacation several times every year.</span>\n11. <span class=\"s1\">I own my own home.</span>\n12. <span class=\"s1\">I have money in the bank and my expenses are always paid with ease.</span>\n13. <span class=\"s1\">I really like all of my neighbors.</span>\n14. <span class=\"s1\">I’ve got an awesome phone and computer and all kinds of cool technological gadgets.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">To me, each of the items on this list seems very normal to me, because they are each a part of my current reality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, these things are HUGE dreams for some people out there. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In fact, just looking at this list makes me feel like my life is pretty great.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  I can’t even imagine living a life without my relationships, my health or my education. Yet,* *there are people out there who live without these blessings every day.</span></span>\n\nIt’s very hard for me to justify dissatisfaction with my life when I look at things from this perspective.  I’m just too grateful for what I have when I look at it this way.\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Why perspective matters</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When I look at this list through the perspective of those who don’t have what I already have, it reminds me just how blessed I truly am. When I look at my life through this lens, it’s easy for me to make peace with where I am. </span>\n\n***Related Article:**[20 Heartfelt Ways to Say Thank You](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/2016/01/06/heartfelt-ways-to-say-thank-you/ \"LOA Article\")*\n\n<span class=\"s1\">When I look through my life focused on what I *haven’t *created or achieved, it’s much, much easier to feel unfulfilled. I’m not at peace when I evaluate my life based on my unfulfilled dreams.  How at peace I am with my life has everything to do with which perspective I choose to take.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In playing this perspective game, you come to see all of the wonderful things you have already created in your life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You are focused on what you HAVE rather than what you DON’T have.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This projects a vibe that shouts out “I am fortunate in so many ways!”</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">A message like this becomes reinforced in your reality, allowing more and more good things to come into your life. The universe must continue to bless you, if you believe you are blessed.</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Work within the paradox!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">So, if you are wanting to use the Law of Attraction to improve your quality of life, make sure you are working within the paradox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You’ve gotta make peace with what is before something better will come along. </span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Remember, your life is great *right here and now, regardless of where you stand.  *There are always dreams you have achieved, and there are always reasons to be grateful.* *When you acknowledge this truth and declare your life to be great, your life will reflect greatness back to you in spades.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">How is your life already great? Why is where you stand a wonderful place to be?

of it or not.  Maybe you’ve noticed that you have a subtle way of picking up on things before they happen or you’re a master at figuring out people’s true motives, or maybe you’re just really good at knowing when not to do something.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all signs that your psychic ability is in good health.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four most common psychic intuitions are: clairvoyance (seeing), clairaudience (hearing), clairsentience (feeling), and claircognizance (knowing).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re probably gifted in all of these areas, but there is likely just one that is your strongest and most proficient.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clairsentience and claircognizance tend to be the most heightened among people, but you can try these exercises to figure exactly which one you exhibit most:</span>\n\n**To test your ‘clairvoyance’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close your eyes and try to picture how your body appears as it is now.  For example, I’m sitting on my couch.  I’d try to think to think about as much detail as I could about how I exist right now.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Am I sitting down?  What kind of clothes do I have on?  Do I look happy, sad or indifferent?  The more crystal clear you can make this picture of yourself, the more clairvoyant you are said to be.</span>\n\n**To test your ‘clairaudience’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close your eyes again, but this time focus solely on all of the different noises and sounds that fill the air around you.  Then, slowly work to eliminate each sound from your head until you find the silence that lies underneath all of the sound.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found this low, universal vibration, listen to your heart beating and the sound of your lungs working.  This can take days to achieve, but if you can, then you are likely clairaudient.</span>\n\n**To test ‘clairsentience’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This test requires that you take a photograph of a person that you do not personally know, but whom someone close to you knows.  Practice analyzing all of the different feelings and emotions you get when you look at the picture of this person.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel like you can trust them?  What kind of person do you think they are?  Good or bad, write down your thoughts and then discuss them with your friend.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that your predictions or thoughts about the person were accurate or significant, you are probably clairsentient.</span>\n\n**To test ‘claircognizance’**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This exercise requires you to look inward, asking for guidance and direction from your higher being.  Once you’ve asked for this guidance, start by writing down a question onto the piece of paper.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then start jotting down whatever thoughts begin flowing through your mind.  Simply write down the words as they come to you; try not to think about what the words or thoughts mean, simply let your thoughts flow and write them down as they come.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you remain consistent with this exercise, your claircognizant ability will eventually become quite prominent, and if you begin to receive messages that are specific or that seem important to you at that time, then you’re likely very claircognizant.</span>\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of us possess some level of psychic ability, whether we’re aware of it or not.  Maybe you’ve noticed

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close your eyes and try to picture how your body appears as it is now.  For example, I’m sitting on my couch.  I’d try to think to think about as much detail as I could about how I exist right now.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Am I sitting down?  What kind of clothes do I have on?  Do I look happy, sad or indifferent?  The more crystal clear you can make this picture of yourself, the more clairvoyant you are said to be.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To test your ‘clairaudience’</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close your eyes again, but this time focus solely on all of the different noises and sounds that fill the air around you.  Then, slowly work to eliminate each sound from your head until you find the silence that lies underneath all of the sound.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve found this low, universal vibration, listen to your heart beating and the sound of your lungs working.  This can take days to achieve, but if you can, then you are likely clairaudient.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To test ‘clairsentience’</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This test requires that you take a photograph of a person that you do not personally know, but whom someone close to you knows.  Practice analyzing all of the different feelings and emotions you get when you look at the picture of this person.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you feel like you can trust them?  What kind of person do you think they are?  Good or bad, write down your thoughts and then discuss them with your friend.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that your predictions or thoughts about the person were accurate or significant, you are probably clairsentient.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To test ‘claircognizance’</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This exercise requires you to look inward, asking for guidance and direction from your higher being.  Once you’ve asked for this guidance, start by writing down a question onto the piece of paper.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then start jotting down whatever thoughts begin flowing through your mind.  Simply write down the words as they come to you; try not to think about what the words or thoughts mean, simply let your thoughts flow and write them down as they come.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you remain consistent with this exercise, your claircognizant ability will eventually become quite prominent, and if you begin to receive messages that are specific or that seem important to you at that time, then you’re likely very claircognizant.</span></p>","image":"http://heartcenteredrebalancing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/feature_image_tecvcvmplate.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":6,"created_at":"2016-05-16T08:51:27.000Z","created_by":5,"updated_at":"2016-05-16T08:51:27.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-05-16T08:51:27.000Z","published_by":5},{"id":418,"uuid":"642b29aa-1eb5-4034-9d3c-abd49b59b97c","title":"Twin

to Grow Lemons From Seed and Have Lemons for Life","slug":"learn-to-grow-lemons-from-seed-and-have-lemons-for-life","markdown":"\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You always hear the phrase ‘when life gives you lemons..’ being said when times are tough.  But it takes on a whole new meaning after you learn how to grow your own lemon tree, because now when life gives you lemons, you simply plant and grow more lemons!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing your own lemon tree is easy and highly rewarding, making it a fun little side project if you’re looking for something to do or simply want a steady supply of lemons.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon trees grow their very hardest when they’re outdoors, year-round, in a hot and sunny climate.  However, they can be grown inside during seasons with cold or not ideal climates.</span>\n\n**To start growing your lemon tree – Procure the following items**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An organic lemon since non-organic lemons often contain non-germinating seeds</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fertile potting soil, preferably containing peat, vermiculite, perlite, and natural fertilizers</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A planting pot that is six inches wide and six inches deep (will be used for sprouting)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seedling pot that is about 24 inches wide by 12 inches deep</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sunny, indoor growing location and possibly a grow light</span>\n\n**Use these steps to grow your lemon tree**\n\n1. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisten the potting soil so that it is damp, but not soaked, all the way through.</span>\n2. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the smaller pot with soil, all the way up to an inch below the rim.</span>\n3. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut open your lemon and remove a seed. Remove all of the pulp from its surface. A good way to do this is to simply suck on it until it is clean.</span>\n4. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not delay to plant. The seed must still be moist when it is buried into the soil. Plant the seed about half an inch deep in the middle of the pot.</span>\n5. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spray the soil that is directly above the seed gently with water from a spray bottle.</span>\n6. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover the pot with clear plastic wrap, seal the edges with a good rubber band, and poke small holes in the top with a pencil.</span>\n7. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Place the pot in a warm, sunny location.</span>\n8. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spray on more water occasionally, not allowing the soil to dry out. Do not cause water to puddle though. Just keep the soil somewhat moist.</span>\n9. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After about two weeks, when the sproutling emerges, take the plastic covering off. If you need additional light for your lemon plant, you can use a grow light to supplement the sun’s light.</span>\n10. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take care of the young plant by keeping the soil damp, by making sure it gets at least eight full hours of light per day, and by giving it moderate doses of organic fertilizer.</span>\n11. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch over your plant to ensure it is not attacked by bugs or diseases. Prune off brown, dead leaves when necessary. Use pesticides if you must. Protect your new lemon tree!</span>\n12. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the plant outgrows its small pot, put it in the larger pot. You will go through much the same procedure when you re-plant it as when you first planted. Younger plants need more water than older plants, but they all do need adequate water. Don’t starve your poor plant after all that work of growing it!</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/57XoFG0QuMI?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is it cheaper to grow your own lemons, but you gain real experience growing plant life, making it valuable as well as educational.  Not to mention, you pretty much have fresh lemons whenever you want them and the lemon tree is a stylish piece of home decor.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, take on a new summer project and see if you can grow your own lemon tree.  And be sure to share this fun idea with someone who loves fresh lemons and growing fruit!</span>\n\nh/t [**EcoSnippet**](http://www.ecosnippets.com/gardening/grow-lemons-from-seed/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You always hear the phrase ‘when life gives you lemons..’ being said when times are tough.  But it takes on a whole new meaning after you learn how to grow your own lemon tree, because now when life gives you lemons, you simply plant and grow more lemons!</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing your own lemon tree is easy and highly rewarding, making it a fun little side project if you’re looking for something to do or simply want a steady supply of lemons.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemon trees grow their very hardest when they’re outdoors, year-round, in a hot and sunny climate.  However, they can be grown inside during seasons with cold or not ideal climates.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>To start growing your lemon tree – Procure the following items</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An organic lemon since non-organic lemons often contain non-germinating seeds</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fertile potting soil, preferably containing peat, vermiculite, perlite, and natural fertilizers</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A planting pot that is six inches wide and six inches deep (will be used for sprouting)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seedling pot that is about 24 inches wide by 12 inches deep</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sunny, indoor growing location and possibly a grow light</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Use these steps to grow your lemon tree</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisten the potting soil so that it is damp, but not soaked, all the way through.</span>  </li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the smaller pot with soil, all the way up to an inch below the rim.</span>  </li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut open your lemon and remove a seed.

friends using AOL or MSN, and I fell in love with video games and technology in general. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But nowadays, the limits of technology aren’t as prominent as when I was a kid.  While I grew up with </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology, what we had was never anything like what the kids of today have.

that my spoiled cousins, who are in elementary school, have had the latest in tech gadgetry for as long as they can remember.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The invasion of technology into our children’s lives has become a concern for some, acknowledging that they are now having to compete (sometimes fiercely) for their child’s attention in a world full of computer user interface interaction.  And they’re worried that it’s going to affect whether or not their kids turn into ‘good’ kids or ‘bad’ kids.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But **[Harvard psychologists have been studying](http://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/)** the things parents do that cause their children to turn out one way or another, and reoccurring themes have popped up everywhere, suggesting that there are still tried-and-true methods of child-rearing that will help your kid become a successful, functioning member of society like we all want them to be.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five tips from **[Harvard psychologists](https://www.facebook.com/makingcaringcommon)** for how to raise your child:</span>\n\n**Spend time with your kids**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most fundamental and useful tip you should take heed of when reading this, spending time with your kids is the most important thing you can do when they’re young.  Ask them questions about their world, how it makes sense to them, and what they think about themselves.  Be sure to really listen and engage with them when you do this, you’ll learn so much about your child, and you’ll be teaching them how to listen to others and care for them.</span>\n\n**If something matters, say it out loud**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanting something for your child is natural, and if it really matters to you then say it out loud to them.  Researchers have said, “even though most parents and caretakers say that their children being caring is a top priority, often children aren’t hearing that message.”  Tell them that you want them to be nice and caring.  And be sure to check in with the adult supervisors that they interact with on a regular basis to see how they’re doing with teamwork and just being a decent being.</span>\n\n**Show your child how to solve their problems**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision-making processes that we all go through on a routine basis have been largely influenced by our parents and the way they did things.  Try going through these processes with them, showing them how to think critically along the way.  For example, if they want to quit the sport they’ve been playing.  Ask them how their decision will affect the other members of the team and whether or not their quitting will help anything.</span>\n\n**Exhibit helpfulness and gratitude regularly**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The researchers say that “studies show that people who engage in the habit of expressing gratitude are more likely to be helpful, generous, compassionate, and forgiving–and they’re also more likely to be happy and healthy.”  Which means that parents should be holding their kids accountable for chores and their expressions of gratitude throughout their days.  However, researchers have suggested that parents only give praise to “uncommon acts of kindness” when it comes to rewarding ‘positive’ behavior.</span>\n\n**Teach them how to see the bigger picture**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the researchers, “almost all children empathize with and care about a small circle of families and friends,” which means that the key to this tip is being able to get them to care about people who lie outside of these familiar circles.  To do this, teach them how to be excellent listeners, encourage them to try to place themselves in another’s position, and use opportune moments to teach them how to empathize.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final quote of the study says this:</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Raising a caring, respectful, ethical child is and always has been hard work. But it’s something all of us can do. And no work is more important or ultimately more rewarding.”</span>\n\nh/t [**UpWorthy**](http://www.upworthy.com/harvard-psychologists-have-been-studying-what-it-takes-to-raise-good-kids-here-are-6-tips)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a millennial, I grew up in an era where technology was on the cusp of booming into what it has transformed into today.  I played computer games that I found in cereal boxes, I instant messaged my friends using AOL or MSN, and I fell in love with video games and technology in general. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But nowadays, the limits of technology aren’t as prominent as when I was a kid.  While I grew up with </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology, what we had was never anything like what the kids of today have.  The iPhone wasn’t a thing until I got to college;

And there’s no need to protect them,” Fennessy told The Dodo.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This perception is slowly starting to become realized as false, and now time is no longer on their side.  One sort of ‘silver lining’ to these animals being researched, however, is that scientists are continuing to learn more about the giraffe’s capacity for emotion, and are weeding out old myths in the process.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zoe Muller, founder of the </span><strong><a href=\"http://www.girafferesearch.com/\">Rothschild’s Giraffe Project</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask any safari guide in Africa about their behavior and they will delight in telling you how female giraffe are bad mothers, apparently abandoning their young hours after giving birth and leaving them alone and vulnerable in the African bush.” </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A notion that Muller has found to be untrue.  One giraffe that she followed during her research gave birth to a calf in the spring of 2010.  At around one month of age and suffering from a deformed leg, the calf struggled to walk and rarely moved because of it.  But the mother giraffe never left its side.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[S]he could always be found next to her calf, standing with it and being vigilant to the surrounding area,” Muller wrote.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the baby calf passed away one morning, most likely due to natural causes.  But, shortly after, Muller discovered 17 other female giraffes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“all highly vigilant and running around in apparently bizarre patterns.”</span></p>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bI20ZglxOI?feature=oembed\" width=\"1170\"></iframe>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Muller is reluctant to categorize their behavior as “mourning,” she acknowledges that it is similar to another mammal that is notorious for their grieving of lost loved ones: elephants.  </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is well documented that elephants show great interest in the carcasses and bones of other dead elephants and herd members, often viewed as evidence of their empathic nature and ability to ‘mourn’ their dead,” she says.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“…</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we are only just beginning to understand the complexities of their social systems and family networks.

class=\"s1\">Did you know that bedtime is an awesome opportunity to**[raise your vibration](http://raiseyourvibrationtoday.com/ \"Raise Your Vibration Today\")** and to set yourself up for more positive manifestations? While we sleep we disconnect our consciousness from the physical world and instead we connect more deeply with our higher self. This connection helps us create with greater ease.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">There’s a reason why people tell you to “sleep on it” when you have a big decision-in our dream state we gain clarity and understanding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We are awesome creators from our sleeping state!</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">In addition to helping us solve our problems and deliberately create, sleep makes us feel good, boosts our immunity, and helps us heal from injury and illness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>So, whenever it’s possible, it’s a good idea to take advantage of sleep.</span>\n\n<span class=\"s1\">Here are 20 things you can do at bedtime to raise your vibration and become a better deliberate creator.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Enjoy!</span>\n\n\n## <span class=\"s1\">Bedtime DOs:</span>\n\n1. <span class=\"s1\">Do give big hugs to the people you love before bedtime, if you live with them 🙂</span>\n2. <span class=\"s1\">After a rough day, do take a shower or bath before bedtime to wash off the stress and elevate your vibration before drifting off.</span>\n3. <span class=\"s1\">Do get some water to put on your nightstand. Sometimes at night we get thirsty, and we always feel better when we’re hydrated.</span>\n4. <span class=\"s1\">Do take a moment to snuggle into bed, and appreciate how comfortable your bedding and pajamas are.</span>\n5. <span class=\"s1\">Do spend a few moments appreciating what went well during the day.</span>\n6. <span class=\"s1\">Do ask a question of the universe before bed. We get lots of clarity from the dream state. You could ask something like “what should I do about that problem at work?” or “what kind of present would my best friend love for her birthday?”</span>\n7. <span class=\"s1\">Do set your intention to enjoy the next day.</span>\n8. <span class=\"s1\">Do create a peaceful atmosphere in your bedroom. Peaceful places inspire peaceful feelings.</span>\n9. <span class=\"s1\">If you like to watch television before bedtime, do be mindful of the programming you select. When we sleep, we often dwell on our last thoughts of the day, so be sure to select programming that’s light and* makes you feel good.*</span>\n10. <span class=\"s1\">Do close the blinds or invest in heavy curtains if you want to sleep in the next day.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The light of day is hard to ignore when it’s shining on your face!</span>\n11. <span class=\"s1\">If you’ve got a few dollars to go shopping, do invest quality bedding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It’s easier to enjoy your sleep when you are comfortable! Being well-rested will help you manifest greater abundance, so comfy bedding *is worth every penny*.</span>\n12. <span class=\"s1\">Do select a soothing alarm for the morning. Awaken to pleasing music or ringtones to gently transition into the daytime.</span>\n13. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to forgive and forget before going to bed. A fight that isn’t resolved at night will just pick right back up in the morning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Why tarnish your tomorrow over something that happened today?</span>\n14. <span class=\"s1\">Do invest in an eye mask and earplugs if you are a light sleeper or if your partner snores.</span>\n15. <span class=\"s1\">Do try out a sleep mediation or sleep hypnosis, especially if you could use a boost!</span>\n16. <span class=\"s1\">Do avoid social media before bedtime.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>There are a lot of things running through your newsfeed, some of which may have the potential to rattle your cage while you are wanting to relax.</span>\n17. <span class=\"s1\">Do take it easy if you find yourself wide awake.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Instead of* trying* to fall asleep, go along with the wakefulness without struggling.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You can tell yourself “I’m just going to relax and take this opportunity to fantasize about pleasant things” and “when my body needs sleep it will shut me down.” The less you struggle, the easier it is to unwind. After all, if you’re going to be awake, you might as well be awake and happy!</span>\n18. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to review your “to do list” in the morning instead of at night. You can’t get tomorrow’s work done today.</span>\n19. <span class=\"s1\">Do choose to go to sleep at a reasonable time (whatever that means for you of course!). Sometimes there are reasons we have to stay up extra late, but when you have the opportunity to enjoy a good night’s rest, take advantage of it!</span>\n20. <span class=\"s1\">If you’re a lucid dreamer, do set your intention to have a lucid dream.
